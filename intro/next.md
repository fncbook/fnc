# Next steps

An accessible but more advanced discussion of machine arithmetic and roundoff error can be found in Higham {cite}`highamAccuracyStability2002`.

Interesting and more advanced discussion of the numerical difficulties of finding the roots of polynomials can be found in the article by Wilkinson, "The Perfidious Polynomial" {cite}`wilkinsonPerfidiousPolynomial1984` and in the ripostes from Cohen, "Is the Polynomial so Perfidious?" {cite}`cohenPolynomialPerfidious1994` and from Trefethen,  "Six myths of polynomial interpolation and quadrature," (Myth 6) {cite}`trefethenSixMyths2011`.
