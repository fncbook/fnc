A text a bit above the level of this text is {cite}`ascherComputerMethods1998`, which covers shooting and finite-difference collocation methods for linear and nonlinear BVPs, with a number of theoretical and applications problems.  A graduate-level text solely on numerical solution of BVPs is `ascherNumericalSolution1995`. Besides the shooting and finite-difference methods, it briefly discusses Galerkin and spline-based methods, and it goes into more depth on theoretical issues.  A more detailed treatment of the Galerkin method can be found in {cite}`quarteroniNumericalMathematics2007`.  An older and accessible treatment of Galerkin and finite element methods can be found in {cite}`strangAnalysisFinite1997`.

For spectral methods, an introduction to BVPs may be found in {cite}`trefethenSpectralMethods2000`, and a more theoretical take is in {cite}`quarteroniNumericalMathematics2007`.

In this chapter, a number of linear variable-coefficient BVPs for so-called special functions were mentioned: Bessel's equation, Laguerre's equation, etc. These ODEs and their solutions arise in the solution of partial differential equations of mathematical physics, and were extensively characterized before prior to wide use of computers ({cite}`abramowitzHandbookMathematical2013`).  These special functions have come to be used for many things and are now available at https://dlmf.nist.gov ({cite}`olverNISTHandbook2010`).
