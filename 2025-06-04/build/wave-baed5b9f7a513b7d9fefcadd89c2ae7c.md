# The wave equation

A close cousin of the advection equation is the {term}`wave equation`.

```{index} ! wave equation
```

````{prf:definition} Wave equation
```{math}
:label: wavepde
    u_{tt} - c^2 u_{xx} = 0.
```
````

The wave equation describes the propagation of waves, such as for sound or light. This is our first PDE having a second derivative in time. Consequently, we should expect to have two initial conditions:

```{math}
:label: waveIC
\begin{split}
u(x,0) &= f(x),  \\
u_t(x,0) &= g(x).
\end{split}
```

There are also two space derivatives, so if boundaries are present, two boundary conditions are required.

In the absence of boundaries, $u(x,t)=\phi(x-ct)$ is a solution of {eq}`wavepde`, just as it is for the advection equation. Now, though, so is $u(x,t)=\phi(x+c t)$ for any twice-differentiable $\phi$ (see @problem-wave-twodir).

```{note}
The wave equation in one dimension supports advection in both directions simultaneously.
```

<!-- We will use $x \in [0,1]$ as the domain.  -->

## First-order system

In order to apply semidiscretization with the standard IVP solvers that we have encountered, we must recast {eq}`wavepde` as a first-order system in time. Using our typical methodology, we would define $y=u_t$ and derive

```{math}
:label: wavefirst1
\begin{split}
  u_t &= y, \\
  y_t &= c^2 u_{xx}.
\end{split}
```

This is a valid approach. However, the wave equation has another, less obvious option for transforming to a first-order system:

```{math}
:label: wavefirst2
\begin{split}
    u_t &= z_x, \\
    z_t &= c^2 u_{x}.
\end{split}
```

```{index} Maxwell's equations
```

This second form is appealing in part because it's equivalent to [Maxwell's equations](wiki:Maxwell%27s_equations) for electromagnetism. In this form, we typically replace the velocity initial condition in {eq}`waveIC` with a condition on $z$,

```{math}
:label: waveIC2
\begin{split}
u(x,0) &= f(x),  \\
z(x,0) &= g(x).
\end{split}
```

This alternative to {eq}`waveIC` is useful in many electromagnetic applications, where $u$ and $z$ represent the electric and magnetic fields, respectively.

## Semidiscretization

Because waves travel in both directions, there is no preferred upwind direction. This makes a centered finite difference in space appropriate. Before application of the boundary conditions, semidiscretization of {eq}`wavefirst2` leads to

```{math}
:label: waveMOL
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{u}'(t) \\[2mm]  \mathbf{z}'(t)
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \boldsymbol{0} & \mathbf{D}_x \\[2mm] c^2 \mathbf{D}_x & \boldsymbol{0}
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{u}(t) \\[2mm] \mathbf{z}(t)
  \end{bmatrix}.
```

We now suppose that the domain is $[0,1]$ and impose the Dirichlet conditions  

```{math}
:label: waveBC
u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0, \qquad t \ge 0.
```

The boundary conditions {eq}`waveBC` suggest that we should remove both of the end values of $\mathbf{u}$ from the discretization, but retain all the $\mathbf{z}$ values. We use $\mathbf{w}(t)$ to denote the vector of all the unknowns in the semidiscretization. If the nodes are numbered $x_0,\ldots,x_m$, then we have

```{math}
:label: wavew
\mathbf{w}(t) =  \begin{bmatrix}
  u_1(t) \\ \vdots \\ u_{m-1}(t) \\ z_0(t) \\ \vdots \\ z_m(t)
\end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix}
  \mathbf{v}(t) \\[1mm] \mathbf{z}(t) 
\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{2m}.
```

When computing $\mathbf{w}'(t)$, we extract the $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{z}$ components, and we define two helper functions: `extend`, which pads the $\mathbf{v}$ component with the zero end values, and `chop`, which deletes them from $\mathbf{u}$ to give $\mathbf{v}$.

We solve the wave equation {eq}`wavefirst2` with speed $c=2$, subject to {eq}`waveBC` and initial conditions {eq}`waveIC2`.

## Variable speed

An interesting situation is when the wave speed $c$ in @wavepde changes discontinuously, as when light passes from one material into another. For this we must replace the term $c^2$ in {eq}`waveMOL` with the matrix $\operatorname{diag}\bigl(c^2(x_0),\ldots,c^2(x_m)\bigr)$.

::::{prf:example} Wave equation with variable speed
:label: demo-wave-speed

We now use a wave speed that is discontinuous at $x=0$; to the left, $c=1$, and to the right, $c=2$.

``````{exercise}
:label: problem-wave-dalembert
✍ Show that the following is a solution to the wave equation $u_{tt}=c^2u_{xx}$ with initial and boundary conditions {eq}`waveBC` and {eq}`waveIC`:

$$

``````

``````{exercise}
:label: problem-wave-neumann
⌨ Suppose the wave equation has homogeneous Neumann conditions on $u$ at each boundary instead of Dirichlet conditions. Using the Maxwell formulation {eq}`wavefirst2`, we have $z_t=c^2u_x$, so $z$ is constant in time at each boundary. Therefore, the endpoint values of $\mathbf{z}$ can be taken from the initial condition and removed from the ODE, while the entire $\mathbf{u}$ vector is now part of the ODE. 

Modify @demo-wave-boundaries to solve the PDE there with Neumann instead of Dirichlet conditions, and make an animation or space-time portrait of the solution. In what major way is it different from the Dirichlet case?
