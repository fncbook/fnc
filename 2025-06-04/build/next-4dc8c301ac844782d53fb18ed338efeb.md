There are many texts on PDEs; a fairly popular undergraduate level text is {cite}`habermanElementaryApplied1998`.  A more advanced treatment is {cite}`ockendonAppliedPartial2003`.

For a more traditional and analytical take on full discretization of the heat equation, one may consult {cite}`smithNumericalSolution1985` or {cite}`mortonNumericalSolution2005`.

Several examples of using the method of lines with spectral method approximation may be found in {cite}`trefethenSpectralMethods2000`.  A classic text on using spectral methods on the PDEs from fluid mechanics is {cite}`canutoSpectralMethods1988`.  The literature on the complex computational fluid dynamics is vast, but one comprehensive monograph is {cite}`roacheFundamentalsComputational1998`.

For a first-hand account of the development of numerical methods for equations governing reservoir simulations (close to the heat equation), see the [article by D. W. Peaceman](http://history.siam.org/peaceman.htm), reprinted from {cite}`nashHistoryScientific1990`.  Those were early days in computing!
