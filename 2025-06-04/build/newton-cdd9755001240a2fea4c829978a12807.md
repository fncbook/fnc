# Newton's method

Newton's method is the cornerstone of rootfinding. We introduce the key idea with an example in @demo-newton-line.

Using general notation, if we have a root approximation $x_k$, we can construct a **linear model** of $f(x)$ using the classic formula for the tangent line of a differentiable function,

```{math}
:label: tangentline
  q(x) = f(x_k) + f'(x_k)(x-x_k).
```

Finding the root of $q(x)=0$ is trivial. We define the next approximation by the condition $q(x_{k+1})=0$, which leads to the following.

```{index} ! Newton's method
```

::::{prf:definition} Newton's method
:label: definition-newtonsmethod
Given a function $f$, its derivative, $f'$, and an initial value $x_1$, iteratively define

```{math}
:label: newton
  x_{k+1} = x_k - \frac{f(x_k)}{f'(x_k)}, \qquad k=1,2,\ldots.
```

Return the sequence $\{x_k\}$.

## Convergence

The graphs of @demo-newton-line suggest why the Newton iteration may converge to a root: any differentiable function looks more and more like its tangent line as we zoom in to the point of tangency. Yet it is far from clear that it *must* converge, or at what rate it will do so. The matter of the convergence rate is fairly straightforward to resolve. Define the error sequence

```{math}
:label: errorseq
\epsilon_k = x_k - r , \quad k=1,2,\ldots,
```

where $r$ is the limit of the sequence and $f(r)=0$. Exchanging $x$-values for $\epsilon$-values in {eq}`newton` gives

```{math}
  \epsilon_{k+1}+r = \epsilon_k + r - \frac{f(r+\epsilon_k)}{f'(r+\epsilon_k)}.
```

We assume that $|\epsilon_k|\to 0$; eventually, the errors remain as small as we please forever. Then a Taylor expansion of $f$ about $x=r$ gives

```{math}
  \epsilon_{k+1} = \epsilon_k - \frac{ f(r) + \epsilon_kf'(r) + \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_k^2f''(r) +
    O(\epsilon_k^3)}{ f'(r) + \epsilon_kf''(r) + O(\epsilon_k^2)}.
```

We use the fact that $f(r)=0$ and additionally assume now that $r$ is a simple root, i.e., $f'(r)\neq 0$. Then

```{math}
\epsilon_{k+1} = \epsilon_k - \epsilon_k \left[ 1 + \dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{f''(r)}{f'(r)} \epsilon_k
+ O(\epsilon_k^2)\right] \, \left[ 1 + \dfrac{f''(r)}{f'(r)}\epsilon_k + O(\epsilon_k^2)\right]^{-1}.
```

The series in the denominator is of the form $1/(1+z)$. Provided $|z|<1$, this is the limit of the geometric series $1-z+z^2-z^3 + \cdots$. Keeping only the lowest-order terms, we derive

\begin{align*}
\label{newtonerr}
\epsilon_{k+1} &= \epsilon_k - \epsilon_k \left[ 1 + \dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{f''(r)}{f'(r)} \epsilon_k + O(\epsilon_k^2) \right] \, \left[ 1 - \dfrac{f''(r)}{f'(r)}
\epsilon_k + O(\epsilon_k^2) \right]\\
&= \frac{1}{2}\, \frac{f''(r)}{f'(r)} \epsilon_k^2 + O(\epsilon_k^3).
\end{align*}

::::{prf:observation}
Asymptotically, each iteration of Newton's method roughly squares the error.

```{index} ! quadratic convergence
```

```{index} ! convergence rate; quadratic
```

::::{prf:definition} Quadratic convergence
:label: definition-quadraticconvergence
Suppose a sequence $x_k$ approaches limit $x^*$. If the error sequence $\epsilon_k=x_k - x^*$ satisfies

```{math}
:label: quadratic-convergence
  \lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{|\epsilon_{k+1}|}{|\epsilon_k|^2} = L
```

for a positive constant $L$, then the sequence has **quadratic convergence** to the limit.
::::

Recall that linear convergence is identifiable by trending toward a straight line on a log-linear plot of the error. When the convergence is quadratic, no such straight line exists—the convergence keeps getting steeper. As a numerical test, note that $|\epsilon_{k+1}|\approx K |\epsilon_{k}|^2$ implies that as $k\to\infty$,

```{math}
:label: quadratictest
\begin{split}
  \log |\epsilon_{k+1}| & \approx 2 \log |\epsilon_{k}| + L,\\
    \frac{\log |\epsilon_{k+1}|}{\log |\epsilon_{k}|} &\approx 2 + \frac{L}{\log |\epsilon_{k}|} \to 2. 
\end{split}
```

Let's summarize the assumptions made to derive quadratic convergence as given by {eq}`newtonerr`:

1. The residual function $f$ has to have enough continuous derivatives to make the Taylor series expansion valid. Often this is stated as $f$ having sufficient *smoothness*. This is usually not a problem, but see @problem-newton-alternate.
2. We required $f'(r)\neq 0$, meaning that $r$ must be a simple root. See @problem-newton-multiple to investigate what happens at a multiple root.
3. We assumed that the sequence converged, which is not easy to guarantee in any particular case. In fact,
finding a starting value from which the Newton iteration converges is often the most challenging part of a rootfinding problem. We will try to deal with this issue in {numref}`section-nonlineqn-quasinewton`.

## Implementation

Our implementation of Newton's iteration is given in {numref}`Function {number} <function-newton>`. It accepts functions that evaluate $f$ and $f'$ and the starting value $x_1$ as input arguments. Beginning programmers are tempted to embed $f$ and $f'$ directly into the code, but there are two good reasons not to do so. First, each new rootfinding problem would require its own copy of the code, creating a lot of duplication. Second, you may want to try more than one rootfinding algorithm for a particular problem, and keeping the definition of the problem separate from the algorithm for its solution makes this task much easier.

```{index} backward error, residual
```

{numref}`Function {number} <function-newton>` also deals with a thorny practical issue: how to stop the iteration. It adopts a three-part criterion. First, it monitors the difference between successive root estimates, $|x_k-x_{k-1}|$, which is used as a stand-in for the unknown error $|x_k-r|$. In addition, it monitors the residual $|f(x_k)|$, which is equivalent to the backward error and more realistic to control in badly conditioned problems (see {numref}`section-nonlineqn-rootproblem`). If either of these quantities is considered to be sufficiently small, the iteration ends. Finally, we need to protect against the possibility of a nonconvergent iteration, so the procedure terminates with a warning if a maximum number of iterations is exceeded.

``````{exercise}
:label: problem-newton-stopping

```{math}
\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} (x_k-x_{k-1}) = 0,
```

but $\{x_k\}$ diverges. (Hint: You have seen such sequences in calculus.) Hence the need for residual tolerances and safety valves in the code!
