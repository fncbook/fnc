{cite}`trefethenSpectralMethods2000` discusses techniques for tensor-product geometry, including eigenvalue problems and problems posed on a disk. Both {cite}`iserlesFirstCourse1996` and {cite}`mortonNumericalSolution2005` discuss finite differences at curved boundaries and present introductions to the finite element method in two dimensions.
