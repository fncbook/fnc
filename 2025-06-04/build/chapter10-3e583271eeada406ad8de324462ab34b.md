### 10.1 @section-bvp-tpbvp

(demo-tpbvp-mems-matlab)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-tpbvp-mems
:open:
```{index} ! Julia; in-place function
```

To define the BVP, we need to define some functions for the ODE and boundary conditions. (For this simple problem, we will use anonymous functions, but for a more substantial one, it would be better to use named functions.) The first, which is similar to what we do for solving IVPs, returns the computed values of $y_1'$ and $y_2'$ given values of the dependent and independent variable.

```{code-cell}
lambda = 0.6;
bvpfcn = @(r, y) [ y(2); lambda / y(1)^2 - y(2) / r  ];    % column vector [y1'(r); y2'(r)]
```

To encode the boundary conditions $y_2(0)=0$, $y_1(2)-1=0$, we define a function for their residual values. In other words, these are quantities that the solver has to make zero in order to satisfy the boundary conditions. 

```{code-cell}
bcfcn = @(ya, yb) [ ya(2); yb(1) - 1 ];    % y_2(a) = 0;  y_1(b) = 1
```

We will define the domain next. Since there is a division by $r$ in the ODE, we want to avoid $r=0$ by truncating the domain a tiny bit. We use equispaced nodes here.

```{code-cell}
nodes = linspace(eps, 1, 61);
```

We need to make one more defintion that isn't part of the mathematical formulation. Rather, it provides an initial guess for the solution. As we will see, this plays the same role as initialization in Newton's method for rootfinding. Here we choose both components to be constant.

```{code-cell}
y_init = @(r) [ 1; 0 ];
sol_init = bvpinit(nodes, y_init);    % create the initial guess
``` 

Now we can solve the BVP using the `bvp4c` function. 

```{code-cell}
sol = bvp4c(bvpfcn, bcfcn, sol_init);

plot(sol.x, sol.y, '-o')
xlabel('r'), ylabel('y(r)')
title('Solution of the membrane problem')
legend("w(r)", "w'(r)", location="east");
```

It's smart to check visually that the boundary conditions are satisfied. The left BC implies a horizontal tangent at $r=0$, and the right BC implies that $w(1)=1$. If the solver failed to satisfy these conditions, we would have to try a different initial guess.

### 10.2 @section-bvp-shooting
(demo-shooting-naive-matlab)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-shooting-naive
:open:
Let's first examine the shooting approach for the TPBVP from {numref}`Example {number} <example-tpbvp-mems>` with $\lambda=0.6$. 

```{code-cell}
lambda = 0.6;
phi = @(r, w, dwdr) lambda ./ w.^2 - dwdr ./ r;
```

We convert the ODE to a first-order system in order to apply a numerical method. We also have to truncate the domain to avoid division by zero.

```{code-cell}
f = @(r, w) [ w(2); phi(r, w(1), w(2)) ];
a = eps;  b = 1;
```

The BVP specifies $w'(0)=y_2(0)=0$. We can try multiple values for the unknown $w(0)=y_1(0)$ and plot the solutions.

```{code-cell}
clf
ivp = ode;
ivp.ODEFcn = f;
ivp.InitialTime = a;
for w0 = 0.4:0.1:0.9
    ivp.InitialValue = [w0; 0];
    sol = solve(ivp, a, b);
    plot(sol.Time, sol.Solution(1, :))
    hold on
end
xlabel('r'),  ylabel('w(r)')
title('Solutions for multiple choices of w(0)')
```

On the graph, it's the curve starting at $w(0)=0.8$ that comes closest to the required condition $w(1)=1$, but it's a bit too large.

(demo-shooting-mems-matlab)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-shooting-mems

We revisit @demo-shooting-naive>` but let {numref}`Function {number} <function-shoot do the heavy lifting.

lambda = 0.6;
phi = @(r, w, dwdr) lambda ./ w.^2 - dwdr ./ r;   
a = eps;  b = 1;    % avoid r=0 in denominator
```

We specify the given and unknown endpoint values.

```{code-cell}
ga = @(u, du) du;
gb = @(u, du) u - 1;
```

```{code-cell}
init = [0.8; 0];    % initial guess for u(a) and u'(a)
[r, w, dwdx] = shoot(phi, a, b, ga, gb, init, 1e-5);
clf,  plot(r, w)
title('Correct solution')
xlabel('r'),  ylabel('w(r)')
```

The value of $w$ at $r=1$, meant to be exactly one, was computed to be

```{code-cell}
format long
w(end)
```

The accuracy is consistent with the error tolerance used for the IVP solution. The initial value $w(0)$ that gave this solution is

```{code-cell}
w(1)
```

The numerical solution above fails to satisfy the boundary condition at $x=1$ for the largest value of $\lambda$.

We test first-order and second-order differentiation matrices for the function $x + \exp(\sin 4x)$ over $[-1,1]$.

```{code-cell}
f = @(x) x + exp(sin(4*x));

For reference, here are the exact first and second derivatives.

```{code-cell}
df_dx = @(x) 1 + 4 * exp(sin(4*x)) .* cos(4*x);
d2f_dx2 = @(x) 4 * exp(sin(4*x)) .* (4*cos(4*x).^2 - 4*sin(4*x));
```

We discretize on equally spaced nodes and evaluate $f$ at the nodes.

```{code-cell}
[t, Dx, Dxx] = diffmat2(12, [-1 1]);
y = f(t);
```

Then the first two derivatives of $f$ each require one matrix-vector multiplication.

```{code-cell}
yx = Dx * y;
yxx = Dxx * y;
```

The results show poor accuracy for this small value of $n$.

```{code-cell}

An convergence experiment confirms the order of accuracy. Because we expect an algebraic convergence rate, we use a log-log plot of the errors.

err = zeros(length(n), 2);

    err(k, 2) = norm(d2f_dx2(t) - Dxx * y, Inf);

    err(k, 2) = norm(d2f_dx2(t) - Dxx * y, Inf);

Since we expect a spectral convergence rate, we use a semi-log plot for the error.

We compare the computed solution to the exact one for increasing $n$.

Each factor of 10 in $n$ reduces error by a factor of 100, which is indicative of second-order convergence.

### 10.5 @section-bvp-nonlinear
(demo-nonlinear-pendulum-matlab)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-nonlinear-pendulum
:open:
Suppose a damped pendulum satisfies the nonlinear equation $\theta'' + 0.05\theta'+\sin \theta =0$. We want to start the pendulum at $\theta=2.5$ and give it the right initial velocity so that it reaches $\theta=-2$ at exactly $t=5$. This is a boundary-value problem with Dirichlet conditions $\theta(0)=2.5$ and $\theta(5)=-2$.

The first step is to define the function $\phi$ that equals $\theta''$.

```{code-cell}
phi = @(t,theta,omega) -0.05 * omega - sin(theta);
```

Next, we define the boundary conditions.

```{code-cell}
ga = @(u, du) u - 2.5;
gb = @(u, du) u + 2;
```

The last ingredient is an initial estimate of the solution. Here we choose $n=100$ and a linear function between the endpoint values. 

```{code-cell}
init = linspace(2.5, -2, 101)';
```

We find a solution with negative initial slope, i.e., the pendulum is initially pushed back toward equilibrium.

```{code-cell}
[t, theta] = bvp(phi, 0, 5, ga, gb, init);
clf,  plot(t, theta)
xlabel('t'),  ylabel('\theta(t)')
title('Pendulum over [0,5]')
```

If we extend the time interval longer for the same boundary values, then the initial slope must adjust.

```{code-cell}
[t, theta] = bvp(phi, 0, 8, ga, gb, init);
plot(t,theta)
xlabel('t'),  ylabel('\theta(t)')
title('Pendulum over [0,8]')
```

This time, the pendulum is initially pushed toward the unstable equilibrium in the upright vertical position before gravity pulls it back down.

(demo-nonlinear-mems-matlab)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-nonlinear-mems
:open:

Here is the problem definition. We use a truncated domain to avoid division by zero at $r=0$.

```{code-cell}
lambda = 0.5;
phi = @(r,w,dwdr) lambda./w.^2 - dwdr./r;
ga = @(w, dw) dw;
gb = @(w, dw) w - 1;
a = eps;  b = 1;
```

First we try a constant function as the initialization.

```{code-cell}
init = ones(301, 1);
[r, w1] = bvp(phi, a, b, ga, gb, init);

clf,  plot(r, w1)
xlabel('r'),  ylabel('w(r)')
title('Solution of the MEMS BVP')
```

It's not necessary that the initialization satisfy the boundary conditions. In fact, by choosing a different constant function as the initial guess, we arrive at another valid solution.

```{code-cell}
init = 0.5 * ones(301, 1);
[r, w2] = bvp(phi, a, b, ga, gb, init);
hold on,  plot(r, w2)

epsilon = 0.05;
phi = @(x, u, du_dx) (u.^3 - u) / epsilon;
ga = @(u, du) du;
gb = @(u, du) u - 1;
```

Finding a solution is easy at larger values of $\epsilon$.

```{code-cell}
init = linspace(-1, 1, 141)';
[x, u1] = bvp(phi, 0, 1, ga, gb, init);
clf,  plot(x, u1, displayname="\epsilon = 0.05")
xlabel('x'),  ylabel('u(x)')
title('Allen-Cahn solution') 
legend(location="northwest") 
```

However, finding a good initialization is not trivial for smaller values of $\epsilon$. Note below that the iteration stops without converging to a solution.

```{code-cell}
epsilon = 0.002;
phi = @(x, u, du_dx) (u.^3 - u) / epsilon;
[x, z] = bvp(phi, 0, 1, ga, gb, init);
```

The iteration succeeds if we use the first solution instead as the initialization here.

```{code-cell}
[x, u2] = bvp(phi, 0, 1, ga, gb, u1);
hold on,  plot(x, u2, displayname="\epsilon = 0.002")
```

In this case we can continue further.

```{code-cell}
epsilon = 0.0005;
phi = @(x, u, du_dx) (u.^3 - u) / epsilon;
[x, u3] = bvp(phi, 0, 1, ga, gb, u2);
