# Matrix-free iterations

In Chapter 4, we solved the nonlinear rootfinding problem $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})=\boldsymbol{0}$ with methods that needed only the ability to evaluate $\mathbf{f}$ at any known value of $\mathbf{x}$. By repeatedly evaluating $\mathbf{f}$ at cleverly chosen points, these algorithms were able to return an estimate for $\mathbf{f}^{-1}(\boldsymbol{0})$.

We can explore the same idea in the context of linear algebra by shifting our viewpoint from matrices to *linear transformations*. If we define $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$, then for all vectors $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{y}$, and scalars $\alpha$,

```{math}
:label: lintrans
\begin{split}
\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y} ) &= \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}) + \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y} ), \\
\mathbf{f}(\alpha \mathbf{x} ) & = \alpha\, \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}).
\end{split}
```

These properties define a linear transformation. Moreover, *every* linear transformation between finite-dimensional vector spaces can be represented as a matrix-vector multiplication.

A close examination reveals that in the power iteration and Krylov subspace methods, the only appearance of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is to apply it a known vector, i.e., to evaluate the linear transformation $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$. If we have access to $\mathbf{f}$, we don't need the matrix at all! That is, Krylov subspace methods can be used to invert a linear transformation if one provides code for the transformation, even if its associated matrix is not known explicitly. That may sound like a strange situation, but it is not uncommon.

## Blurring images

```{index} image (as a matrix)
```

In {numref}`section-matrixanaly-insight` we saw that a grayscale image can be represented as an $m\times n$ matrix $\mathbf{X}$ of pixel intensity values. Now consider a simple model for blurring the image. Define $\mathbf{B}$ as the $m\times m$ tridiagonal matrix

```{math}
:label: blurmatrix
B_{ij} =
\begin{cases}
\tfrac{1}{2} & \text{if $i=j$},\\
\tfrac{1}{4} & \text{if $|i-j|=1$},\\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
```

The product $\mathbf{B}\mathbf{X}$ applies $\mathbf{B}$ to each column of $\mathbf{X}$. Within that column it does a weighted average of the values of each pixel and its two neighbors. That has the effect of blurring the image vertically. We can increase the amount of blur by applying $\mathbf{B}$ repeatedly.

In order to blur horizontally, we can transpose the image and apply blurring in the same way. We need a blurring matrix defined as in {eq}`blurmatrix` but with size $n\times n$. We call this matrix $\mathbf{C}$. Altogether the horizontal blurring is done by transposing, applying $\mathbf{C}$, and transposing back to the original orientation. That is,

```{math}
\bigl(\mathbf{C} \mathbf{X}^T\bigr)^T = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{C}^T = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{C},
```

using the symmetry of $\mathbf{C}$. So we can describe blur in both directions as the function

```{math}
:label: blurfunction
\operatorname{blur}(\mathbf{X}) = \mathbf{B}^k \mathbf{X} \mathbf{C}^k
```

for a positive integer $k$.

## Deblurring

A more interesting operation is *deblurring*: given an image blurred by poor focus, can we reconstruct the true image? Conceptually, we want to invert the function $\operatorname{blur}(\mathbf{X})$.

It's easy to see from {eq}`blurfunction` that the blur operation is a linear transformation on image matrices. But an $m\times n$ image matrix is equivalent to a length-$mn$ vector—it's just a matter of interpreting the shape of the same data. Let $\operatorname{vec}(\mathbf{X})=\mathbf{x}$ and $\operatorname{unvec}(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{X}$ be the mathematical statements of such reshaping operations. Now say $\mathbf{X}$ is the original image and $\mathbf{Z}=\operatorname{blur}(\mathbf{X})$ is the blurred one. Then by linearity there is some matrix $\mathbf{A}$ such that

```{math}
\mathbf{A} \operatorname{vec}(\mathbf{X}) = \operatorname{vec}(\mathbf{Z}),
```

or $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{z}$.

The matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is $mn\times mn$; for a 12-megapixel image, it would have $1.4\times 10^{14}$ entries! Admittedly, it is extremely sparse, but the point is that we don't need it at all.

Instead, given any vector $\mathbf{u}$ we can compute $\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{u}$ through the steps

\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{U} &= \operatorname{unvec}(\mathbf{u}), \\
  \mathbf{V} &= \operatorname{blur}(\mathbf{U}), \\
  \mathbf{v} &= \operatorname{vec}(\mathbf{V}).
\end{align*}

The following example shows how to put these ideas into practice with MINRES.
