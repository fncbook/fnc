# The QR factorization

```{index} ! orthogonal vectors, ! orthonormal vectors
```

Sets of vectors satisfying a certain property are useful both theoretically and computationally.

::::{prf:definition} Orthogonal vectors
:label: definition-orthogonal
Two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are **orthogonal** if $\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{v}=0$. We say that a collection of vectors $\mathbf{q}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{q}_k$ is orthogonal if

```{math}
:label: orthogonality
i \neq j \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{q}_i^T\mathbf{q}_j = 0.
```

If {eq}`orthogonality` applies and also $\mathbf{q}_i^T\mathbf{q}_i=1$ for all $i=1,\ldots,n$, we say the vectors are **orthonormal**.
::::

```{index} inner product
```

In two and three dimensions, orthogonality is the same as perpendicularity. 

Orthogonal vectors simplify inner products. For example, if $\mathbf{q}_1$ and $\mathbf{q}_2$ are orthogonal, then

```{math}
:label: orthosubtract
\| \mathbf{q}_1 - \mathbf{q}_2 \|_2^2 = (\mathbf{q}_1-\mathbf{q}_2)^T(\mathbf{q}_1-\mathbf{q}_2)
= \mathbf{q}_1^T\mathbf{q}_1 - 2 \mathbf{q}_1^T\mathbf{q}_2 + \mathbf{q}_2^T\mathbf{q}_2
= \|\mathbf{q}_1\|_2^2 + \|\mathbf{q}_2\|_2^2.
```

As in the rest of this chapter, we will be using the 2-norm exclusively. 

```{index} subtractive cancellation
```

Equation {eq}`orthosubtract` is the key to the computational attractiveness of orthogonality. {numref}`fig-nonorthogonal` shows how nonorthogonal vectors can allow a multidimensional version of subtractive cancellation, in which $\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\|$ is much smaller than $\|\mathbf{x}\|$ and $\|\mathbf{y}\|$. As the figure illustrates, orthogonal vectors do not allow this phenomenon. By {eq}`orthosubtract`, the magnitude of a vector difference or sum is larger than the magnitudes of the original vectors. 

```{figure} figures/nonorthogonal.svg
:name: fig-nonorthogonal
Nonorthogonal vectors can cause cancellation when subtracted, but orthogonal vectors never do.
```

```{prf:observation}
Addition and subtraction of vectors are guaranteed to be well conditioned when the vectors are orthogonal.
```

## Orthogonal and ONC matrices

Statements about orthogonal vectors are often made more easily in matrix form. Let $\mathbf{Q}$ be an $n\times k$ matrix whose columns $\mathbf{q}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{q}_k$ are orthogonal vectors. The orthogonality conditions {eq}`orthogonality` become simply that $\mathbf{Q}^T\mathbf{Q}$ is a diagonal matrix, since

```{math}
\mathbf{Q}^T \mathbf{Q} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{q}_1^T \\[1mm] \mathbf{q}_2^T \\ \vdots \\ \mathbf{q}_k^T
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{q}_1 & \mathbf{q}_2 &  \cdots & \mathbf{q}_k
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{q}_1^T\mathbf{q}_1 & \mathbf{q}_1^T\mathbf{q}_2 & \cdots & \mathbf{q}_1^T\mathbf{q}_k \\[1mm]
\mathbf{q}_2^T\mathbf{q}_1 & \mathbf{q}_2^T\mathbf{q}_2 & \cdots & \mathbf{q}_2^T\mathbf{q}_k \\
\vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\
\mathbf{q}_k^T\mathbf{q}_1 & \mathbf{q}_k^T\mathbf{q}_2 & \cdots & \mathbf{q}_k^T\mathbf{q}_k
\end{bmatrix}.
```

If the columns of $\mathbf{Q}$ are orthonormal, then $\mathbf{Q}^T\mathbf{Q}$ is the $k\times k$ identity matrix. This is such an important property that we will break with common practice here and give this type of matrix a name. 

```{index} ! ONC matrix
```

(definition-qr-ONC)=
```{prf:definition} ONC matrix
An **ONC matrix** is one whose columns are an orthonormal set of vectors. 
```

(theorem-qr-ONC)=
````{prf:theorem} ONC matrix

Suppose $\mathbf{Q}$ is a real $n\times k$ ONC matrix (matrix with orthonormal columns). Then:

1. $\mathbf{Q}^T\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{I}$ ($k\times k$ identity).
2. $\| \mathbf{Q}\mathbf{x} \|_2 = \| \mathbf{x} \|_2$ for all $k$-vectors $\mathbf{x}$.
3. $\| \mathbf{Q} \|_2=1$.
````

````{prf:proof}
:enumerated: false

The first part is derived above. The second part follows a pattern that has become well established by now:

```{math}
\| \mathbf{Q}\mathbf{x} \|_2^2 = (\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{x})^T(\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{Q}^T \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{I} \mathbf{x} = \| \mathbf{x} \|_2^2.
```

The last part of the theorem is left to the exercises.
````

```{index} ! orthogonal matrix
```

Of particular interest is a *square* ONC matrix.[^ortho] 

```{prf:definition}
An **orthogonal matrix** is a square matrix with orthonormal columns.
```

Orthogonal matrices have properties beyond @theorem-qr-ONC. 

[^ortho]: Confusingly, a square matrix whose columns are orthogonal is not necessarily an orthogonal matrix; the columns must be orthonormal, which is a stricter condition.


(theorem-qr-orthogmatrix)=
````{prf:theorem} Orthogonal matrix

Suppose $\mathbf{Q}$ is an $n\times n$ real orthogonal matrix. Then:
1. $\mathbf{Q}^T = \mathbf{Q}^{-1}$.
2. $\mathbf{Q}^T$ is also an orthogonal matrix.
3. $\kappa(\mathbf{Q})=1$ in the 2-norm.
4. For any other $n\times n$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$, $\| \mathbf{A}\mathbf{Q} \|_2=\| \mathbf{A} \|_2$.
5. If $\mathbf{U}$ is another $n\times n$ orthogonal matrix, then $\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{U}$ is also orthogonal.
````

::::{prf:proof}
:enumerated: false
Since $\mathbf{Q}$ is an ONC matrix, $\mathbf{Q}^T\mathbf{Q}=\mathbf{I}$. All three matrices are $n\times n$, so $\mathbf{Q}^{-1}=\mathbf{Q}^T$. The proofs of the other statements are left to the exercises.

## Orthogonal factorization

```{index} ! matrix factorization; QR
```

Now we come to another important way to factor a matrix: the **QR factorization**. As we will show below, the QR factorization plays a role in linear least squares analogous to the role of LU factorization in linear systems.

(theorem-qr-QR)=
````{prf:theorem} QR factorization
Every real $m\times n$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ ($m\ge n$) can be written as $\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{R}$, where $\mathbf{Q}$ is an $m\times m$ orthogonal matrix and $\mathbf{R}$ is an $m\times n$ upper triangular matrix.
````

In most introductory books on linear algebra, the QR factorization is derived through a process known as **Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization**. However, while it is an important tool for theoretical work, the Gram–Schmidt process is numerically unstable. We will consider an alternative construction in {numref}`section-leastsq-house`.

When $m$ is much larger than $n$, which is often the case, there is a compressed form of the factorization that is more efficient. In the product

```{math}
\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{q}_1 & \mathbf{q}_2 & \cdots & \mathbf{q}_m
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & \cdots & r_{1n} \\
0 & r_{22} & \cdots &  r_{2n} \\
\vdots & & \ddots & \vdots\\
0 & 0 & \cdots & r_{nn} \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots &  & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & 0
\end{bmatrix},
```

the vectors $\mathbf{q}_{n+1},\ldots,\mathbf{q}_m$ always get multiplied by zero. Nothing about $\mathbf{A}$ is lost if we delete them and reduce the factorization to the equivalent form

```{math}
:label: economyqr
\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{q}_1 & \mathbf{q}_2 & \cdots & \mathbf{q}_n
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & \cdots & r_{1n} \\
0 & r_{22} & \cdots &  r_{2n} \\
\vdots & & \ddots & \vdots\\
0 & 0 & \cdots & r_{nn}
\end{bmatrix} = \hat{\mathbf{Q}} \hat{\mathbf{R}}.
```

::::{prf:definition} Thin QR factorization
The thin QR factorization is $\mathbf{A} = \hat{\mathbf{Q}} \hat{\mathbf{R}}$, where $\hat{\mathbf{Q}}$ is $m\times n$ and ONC, and $\hat{\mathbf{R}}$ is $n\times n$ and upper triangular.

## Least squares and QR

```{index} linear least-squares problem
```

```{index} normal equations
```

If we substitute the thin factorization {eq}`economyqr` into the normal equations {eq}`normaleqns`, we can simplify expressions a great deal.

```{math}
\begin{split}
  \mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} &= \mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{b}, \\
  \hat{\mathbf{R}}^T \hat{\mathbf{Q}}^T \hat{\mathbf{Q}} \hat{\mathbf{R}} \mathbf{x} &= \hat{\mathbf{R}}^T \hat{\mathbf{Q}}^T \mathbf{b}, \\
  \hat{\mathbf{R}}^T \hat{\mathbf{R}} \mathbf{x}& = \hat{\mathbf{R}}^T \hat{\mathbf{Q}}^T \mathbf{b}.
\end{split}
```

In order to have the normal equations be well posed, we require that $\mathbf{A}$ is not rank-deficient (as proved in @theorem-ATA). This is enough to guarantee that $\hat{\mathbf{R}}$ is nonsingular (see @problem-qr-nonsingR). Therefore, its transpose is nonsingular as well, and we arrive at

```{math}
:label: lsqr
\hat{\mathbf{R}} \mathbf{x}=\hat{\mathbf{Q}}^T \mathbf{b}.
```

(algorithm-qr-solve)=
::::{prf:algorithm} Solution of linear least squares by thin QR

1. Compute the thin QR factorization $\hat{\mathbf{Q}}\hat{\mathbf{R}}=\mathbf{A}$.
1. Compute $\mathbf{z} = \hat{\mathbf{Q}}^T\mathbf{b}$.
1. Solve the $n\times n$ linear system $\hat{\mathbf{R}}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{z}$ for $\mathbf{x}$.
::::

This algorithm is implemented in {numref}`Function {number} <function-lsqrfact>`. It is essentially the algorithm used internally by Julia when `A\b` is called. The execution time is dominated by the factorization, the most common method for which is described in {numref}`section-leastsq-house`.

The solution of least-squares problems via QR factorization is more stable than when the normal equations are formulated and solved directly.
