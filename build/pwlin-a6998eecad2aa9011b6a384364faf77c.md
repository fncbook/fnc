# Piecewise linear interpolation

```{index} interpolation; by piecewise polynomials
```

```{index} ! piecewise linear interpolant
```

Piecewise linear interpolation is simply a game of connect-the-dots. That is, the data points are joined pairwise by line segments.

::::{prf:definition} Piecewise linear interpolant
Given nodes $t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_n$, the **piecewise linear** interpolant $p(x)$ is given by

```{math}
:label: pwlinear
p(x) = y_k + \frac{y_{k+1}-y_k}{t_{k+1}-t_k}(x-t_k) \quad \text{ for } x\in[t_k,t_{k+1}].
```
::::

It should be clear from {eq}`pwlinear` that on each interval $[t_k,t_{k+1}]$, $p(x)$ is a linear function passing through both $(t_k,y_k)$ and $(t_{k+1},y_{k+1})$.

## Hat functions

Rather than basing an implementation on {eq}`pwlinear`, we return to the idea used in @demo-interp-vander of choosing the interpolant from among the linear combinations of a preselected finite set of functions. In the present context we use, for $k=0,\ldots,n$,

```{math}
:label: hatfun
  H_k(x) =
  \begin{cases}
    \dfrac{x-t_{k-1}}{t_k-t_{k-1}} & \text{if $x\in[t_{k-1},t_k]$},\\[2.5ex]
    \dfrac{t_{k+1}-x}{t_{k+1}-t_{k}} & \text{if $x\in[t_{k},t_{k+1}]$},\\[2.5ex]
    0 & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases} \qquad  
```

```{index} hat functions
```

The functions $H_0,\ldots,H_n$ are called **hat functions**. They depend on the node vector $\mathbf{t}$, but this dependence is not usually indicated explicitly.

Each hat function is globally continuous and is linear inside every interval $[t_k,t_{k+1}]$.  Consequently, any linear combination of them will have the same property. Furthermore, *any* such function is expressible as a unique linear combination of hat functions, i.e.,

```{math}
:label: plbasis
  \sum_{k=0}^n c_k H_k(x)
```

for some choice of the coefficients $c_0,\ldots,c_n$. No smaller set of functions can have the same properties. We summarize these facts by calling the hat functions a **basis** of the set of functions that are continuous and piecewise linear relative to $\mathbf{t}$.  Another point of view, familiar from abstract linear algebra, is that a basis sets up a one-to-one correspondence between the spanned function space and the more familiar space $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, with each function being represented by its coefficients $c_0,\ldots,c_n$.

An appealing characteristic of the hat function basis is that it depends only on the node locations, while the expansion coefficients in {eq}`plbasis` depend only on the data values. This clean separation would be useful if we wanted to construct many interpolants on the same node set, and it has deeper theoretical uses as well.

{numref}`Function {number} <function-hatfun>` presents a simple implementation of hat functions. The inputs are a presorted vector of nodes and a value of $k$ between 0 and $n$, which represent the indices of the endpoints. The return value is a function of $x$ that can be evaluated as needed. Note that we have not formally defined values for a hat function outside of the node interval; our choice in {numref}`Function {number} <function-hatfun>` is to make it zero there.

## Cardinality conditions

```{index} cardinal function
```

A handy property of the hat functions is that they are cardinal functions for piecewise linear interpolation, since they satisfy the cardinality conditions

```{math}
:label: cardinalcond
H_k(t_i) =
\begin{cases}
  1 &\text{if $i=k$,}\\
  0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
```

All candidate piecewise linear (PL) functions can be expressed as a linear combination such as {eq}`plbasis` for some coefficients $c_0,\ldots,c_n$. But because of the cardinality conditions and the necessity for $p(x)$ to interpolate the data values in $\mathbf{y}$, expressing the interpolant using the hat functions is trivial:

```{math}
:label: plbasissol
  p(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n y_k H_k(x).
```

The resulting algorithmic simplicity is reflected in {numref}`Function {number} <function-plinterp>`. Take note that the output of {numref}`Function {number} <function-plinterp>` is itself a function, meant to be called with a single argument representing a value of $x$. Our mathematical viewpoint is that the result of an interpolation process is a function, and our codes reflect this.

## Conditioning and convergence

The condition number bounds from @theorem-interp-conditioning are very simple for piecewise linear interpolation because the interpolant of the data $\mathbf{e}_k$ is just the hat function $H_k$. Hence $1\le \kappa \le n+1$. However, there is an even simpler result.

```{index} condition number; of interpolation
```

(theorem-plcondition)=
````{prf:theorem} Conditioning of PL interpolation
The absolute condition number of piecewise linear interpolation in the infinity norm equals 1. More specifically, if $\mathcal{I}$ is the piecewise linear interpolation operator, then 

```{math}
:label: plcondition
\| \mathcal{I}(\mathbf{y}+\mathbf{z}) - \mathcal{I}(\mathbf{y}) \|_\infty = \|\mathbf{z}\|_\infty.
```

(The norm on the left side is on functions, while the norm on the right side is on vectors.)
````

````{prf:proof}
:enumerated: false


By linearity,

```{math}
\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{y}+\mathbf{z}) - \mathcal{I}(\mathbf{y}) = \mathcal{I}(\mathbf{z}) = \sum_{k=0}^n z_k H_k(x).
```

Call this piecewise linear function $p(x)$. Consider a maximum element of $\mathbf{z}$, i.e., choose $i$ such that $|z_i|=\|\mathbf{z}\|_\infty$. Then $|p(t_i)|=\|\mathbf{z}\|_\infty$. Hence $\|p\|_\infty\ge \|\mathbf{z}\|_\infty$. Now consider

```{math}
|p(x)| = \left|\sum_{k=0}^n z_k H_k(x)\right| \le \sum_{k=0}^n |z_k| H_k(x) \le \|\mathbf{z}\|_\infty \sum_{k=0}^n H_k(x) = \|\mathbf{z}\|_\infty.
```

You are asked to prove the final step above in @problem-pwlin-partition. We conclude that  $\|p\|_\infty\le \|\mathbf{z}\|_\infty$, so that $\|p\|_\infty = \|\mathbf{z}\|_\infty$, which completes the proof.
````

Now suppose that $f$ is a "nice" function on an interval $[a,b]$ containing all the nodes. We can sample values of $f$ to get data, i.e., $y_k=f(t_k)$ for all $k$, then perform piecewise linear interpolation of the data to get a different function, the interpolant $p$. How close is $p$ to the original $f$? 

To make a simple statement, we will consider only the case of equally spaced nodes covering the interval. It turns out that piecewise linear interpolation converges at second order in the spacing of the nodes.

(theorem-pwlin-converge)=
````{prf:theorem} Convergence of PL interpolation
Suppose that $f(x)$ has a continuous second derivative in $[a,b]$ (often expressed as $f\in C^2([a,b])$). Let $p_n(x)$ be the piecewise linear interpolant of $\bigl(t_i,f(t_i)\bigr)$ for $i=0,\ldots,n$, where $t_i=a+i h$ and $h=(b-a)/n$. Then
  
```{math}
:label: placcuracy
\bigl\| f - p_n \bigr\|_\infty = \max_{x \in [a,b]}
|f(x)-p(x)| \le M h^2,
```

where $M = \bigl\| f'' \bigr\|_\infty$.
````

For an outline of a proof, see @problem-pwlin-placcuracy.

We normally don't have access to $f''$, so the importance of @theorem-pwlin-converge is that the error in the interpolant is $O(h^2)$ as $h\to 0$. 

```{index} ! convergence rate; algebraic, ! order of accuracy; of an approximation
```

(definition-pwlin-algconv)=
::::{prf:definition} Algebraic convergence
If an approximation has error that is $O(h^m)$ as $h\to 0$ for an integer $m$ and a discretization size parameter $h$, then we say the approximation has **algebraic convergence**. If the error is not also $O(h^{m+1})$, then $m$ is the **order of accuracy**.
::::

Thus, @theorem-pwlin-converge states that piecewise linear interpolation is second-order accurate. For instance, if we increase the number of equally spaced nodes by a factor of 10, the piecewise linear interpolant becomes about 100 times more accurate. Note also that if $y \approx C h^m$, then 

$$
\log y \approx m (\log h) + \log C.
$$

Hence a log-log graph of error versus $h$ should be approximately a straight line of slope $m$.
