# Setting up MATLAB for this book

The book relies only on base MATLAB (no Toolboxes). The code requires MATLAB R2023b or later.

## Installation

- To install in MATLAB Online, you can click this button:
[![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=fncbook/FNC-matlab&file=toolbox/release/FNC.mltbx)
- To install the functions locally, you can download the latest `mltbx` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/fncbook/FNC-matlab/releases). Double-click the file, or load it in to the MATLAB Add-On Manager.
- The old-school way is to download a source code zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/fncbook/FNC-matlab/releases) and unpack it somewhere on your computer. Then add its top-level directory to your MATLAB path by using the `addpath` command or the `pathtool` GUI.
