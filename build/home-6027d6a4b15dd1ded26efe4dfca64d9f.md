This is a new edition of the textbook [Fundamentals of Numerical Computation](https://tobydriscoll.net/FNC) by Tobin A. Driscoll and Richard J. Braun. A hardcopy is [available for purchase](https://my.siam.org/Store/Product/viewproduct/?ProductId=41831895) at the SIAM Bookstore. This material is copyright Â© Society of Applied and Industrial Mathematics, 2022. 


The book was originally written for MATLAB. That version is still [available for purchase](https://my.siam.org/Store/Product/viewproduct/?ProductId=29215528) at the SIAM Bookstore. This new edition is largely the same, but you should not expect exercise numbers to align perfectly in both editions.
