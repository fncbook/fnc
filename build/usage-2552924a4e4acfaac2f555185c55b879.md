# How to use this book

## Everyone

First, set up your computing environment:

- [Julia](#section-setup-julia)
- [MATLAB](#section-setup-matlab)
- [Python](#section-setup-python)

This book is littered with computer examples. All the code used to generate the content you see is given to you. Here is a Julia example:

```{code-cell}
println("Welcome to Julia! Do you know π to 100 digits? Because I do! Look:)
setprecision(328)
BigFloat(π)
```

If you hover over the code cell, you will see an icon in the upper right corner that allows you to copy to code to your clipboard. You will probably do this kind of thing a lot, if you work though this book.
