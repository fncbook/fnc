# Computing QR factorizations

```{index} orthogonal matrix
```

It is possible to compute a thin QR factorization using the outer product formula {eq}`matrixouter`, as we did with LU. However, to stably compute the factorization, a better strategy is to introduce zeros into the lower triangle, one column at a time, using orthogonal matrices. Thanks to {numref}`Theorem %s <theorem-qr-orthogmatrix>`, the product of orthogonal matrices will also be orthogonal.

## Householder reflections

We will use a particular type of orthogonal matrix.

```{index} ! Householder reflector, orthogonal matrix
```

::::{prf:definition} Householder reflector
A **Householder reflector** is a matrix of the form

```{math}
:label: hhreflect
  \mathbf{P} = \mathbf{I} - 2 \mathbf{v} \mathbf{v}^T,
```

where $\mathbf{v}$ is any unit vector (in the 2-norm).
::::

In [Exercise 2](#problem-house-reflector) you are asked to show that such a $\mathbf{P}$ is necessarily orthogonal. Note that for any vector $\mathbf{x}$ of appropriate dimension,

```{math}
:label: hhapply
  \mathbf{P}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x} - 2 \mathbf{v} (\mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{x}).
```

The reason $\mathbf{P}$ is called a reflector is sketched in {numref}`fig-hhreflect`.

```{figure} figures/hhreflect.svg
:name: fig-hhreflect
A Householder reflector. Because $\mathbf{v}$ is a unit vector, $\mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{x}$ is the component of $\mathbf{x}$ in the direction of $\mathbf{v}$. Hence subtracting $(\mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{x})\mathbf{v}$ projects $\mathbf{x}$ into a hyperplane orthogonal to $\mathbf{v}$. By subtracting off twice as much, we get the reflection of $\mathbf{x}$ through the hyperplane instead.
```

Given a vector $\mathbf{z}$, we can choose $\mathbf{v}$ so that $\mathbf{P}$ reflects $\mathbf{z}$ onto the $x_1$-axis—i.e., so that $\mathbf{P}\mathbf{z}$ is nonzero only in the first element. Because orthogonal matrices preserve the 2-norm, we must have

```{math}
:label: hhgoal
\mathbf{P}\mathbf{z} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\pm \| \mathbf{z} \|\\0 \\ \vdots \\ 0
\end{bmatrix} = \pm \| \mathbf{z} \| \mathbf{e}_1.
```

(Recall that $\mathbf{e}_k$ is the $k$th column of the identity matrix.) We choose the positive sign above for our discussion, but see {numref}`Function {number} <function-qrfact>` and [Exercise 4](#problem-house-sign) for important computational details. Let

```{math}
:label: hhvector
  \mathbf{w} = \| \mathbf{z} \| \mathbf{e}_1-\mathbf{z}, \quad \mathbf{v} = \frac{\mathbf{w}}{\|\mathbf{w}\|}.
```

If it turns out that $\mathbf{w}=\boldsymbol{0}$, then $\mathbf{z}$ is already in the target form and we can take $\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{I}$.  Otherwise, we have the following.

(theorem-hhreflect)=
````{prf:theorem} Householder reflector
Let $\mathbf{v}$ be defined by {eq}`hhvector` and let $\mathbf{P}$ be given by {eq}`hhreflect`. Then $\mathbf{P}$ is symmetric and orthogonal, and $\mathbf{P}\mathbf{z}=\| \mathbf{z} \|\mathbf{e}_1$.
````

````{prf:proof}
The proofs of symmetry and orthogonality are left to [Exercise 2](#problem-house-reflector). For the last fact, we use {eq}`hhapply` to compute
  
```{math}
\mathbf{P}\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{z} - 2 \frac{\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{z}}{\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{w}} \mathbf{w}.
```

Since $\mathbf{e}_1^T\mathbf{z}=z_1$,
  
```{math}
\begin{split}
    \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{w} &= \| \mathbf{z} \|^2 - 2 \| \mathbf{z} \| z_1 + \mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{z}
    = 2\| \mathbf{z} \|(\| \mathbf{z} \|-z_1),\\
    \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{z} &= \| \mathbf{z} \|z_1 - \mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{z} = -\| \mathbf{z} \|\bigl(\| \mathbf{z} \|-z_1\bigr),
\end{split}
```

leading finally to
  
```{math}
\mathbf{P}\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{z} - 2\cdot
\frac{-\| \mathbf{z} \| \bigl(\| \mathbf{z} \|-z_1\bigr)}{2\| \mathbf{z} \| \bigl(\| \mathbf{z} \|-z_1\bigr)} \mathbf{w}
= \mathbf{z} + \mathbf{w} = \| \mathbf{z} \|\mathbf{e}_1.
```
````

## Factorization algorithm

```{index} matrix factorization; QR
```

The QR factorization is computed by using successive Householder reflections to introduce zeros in one column at a time. We first show the process for a small numerical example in {numref}`Demo %s <demo-house-qr>`.

(demo-house-qr)=
::::{prf:example} Householder QR factorization
`````{tab-set} 
````{tab-item} Julia
:sync: julia
:::{embed} #demo-house-qr-julia
:::
```` 

````{tab-item} MATLAB
:sync: matlab
:::{embed} #demo-house-qr-matlab
:::
```` 

````{tab-item} Python
:sync: python
:::{embed} #demo-house-qr-python
:::
```` 
`````
::::

You may be wondering what happened to $\mathbf{Q}$ in {numref}`Demo %s <demo-house-qr>`. Each Householder reflector is orthogonal but not full-size. We have to pad it out to represent algebraically the fact that a block of the first rows is left alone. Given a reflector $\mathbf{P}_k$ that is of square size $m-k+1$, we define

```{math}
\mathbf{Q}_k =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{I}_{k-1} & \boldsymbol{0} \\ \boldsymbol{0} & \mathbf{P}_k
\end{bmatrix}.
```

It is easy to show that $\mathbf{Q}_k$ is also orthogonal. Then the algorithm produces

```{math}
  \mathbf{Q}_n \mathbf{Q}_{n-1}\cdots \mathbf{Q}_1 \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{R}.
```

But $\mathbf{Q}_n \mathbf{Q}_{n-1}\cdots \mathbf{Q}_1$ is orthogonal too, and we multiply on the left by its transpose to get $\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{R}$, where $\mathbf{Q} =  (\mathbf{Q}_n \mathbf{Q}_{n-1}\cdots \mathbf{Q}_1)^T$. We don't even need to form these matrices explicitly. Writing

```{math}
:label: hhbuildQ
\mathbf{Q}^T = \mathbf{Q}_n \mathbf{Q}_{n-1}\cdots \mathbf{Q}_1 = \mathbf{Q}_n \Bigl( \mathbf{Q}_{n-1}\bigl(\cdots (\mathbf{Q}_1\mathbf{I})\cdots\bigr)\Bigr),
```

we can build $\mathbf{Q}^T$ iteratively by starting with the identity and doing the same row operations as on $\mathbf{A}$. That process uses much less memory than building the $\mathbf{Q}_k$ matrices explicitly.

The algorithm we have described is encapsulated in {numref}`Function {number} <function-qrfact>`. There is one more refinement in it, however. As indicated by {eq}`hhapply`, the application of a reflector $\mathbf{P}$ to a vector does not require the formation of the matrix $\mathbf{P}$ explicitly.

## Q-less QR and least squares

In {numref}`Demo {number} <demo-qr-qrfact>` it was seen that the $\mathbf{Q}$ output of Julia's `qr` function is not a standard matrix. The reason is that Equation {eq}`lsqr` shows that in order to solve the linear least-squares problem, all we need from $\mathbf{Q}$ is the computation of $\hat{\mathbf{Q}}^T\mathbf{b}$. Referring again to {eq}`hhbuildQ` and {eq}`hhapply`, the special structure of the reflectors is such that for this computation, we only need to apply code similar to lines 18 and 21 of {numref}`Function {number} <function-qrfact>` for each of the Householder vectors $\mathbf{v}$ that is constructed. 

This observation leads to the idea of the *Q-less QR factorization*, in which the full or thin $\mathbf{Q}$ is never computed explicitly. This is the variant used by Julia's `qr`. The returned value `Q` used within {numref}`Function {number} <function-lsqrfact>` is of a special type that allows Julia to perform `Q'*b` efficiently for the least-squares solution. 

In [Exercise 8](#problem-house-flops) you are asked to derive the following result about the Q-less factorization.

(theorem-house-flops)=
:::{prf:theorem} 
Q-less QR factorization by Householder reflections takes $\sim(2mn^2-\frac{2}{3}n^3)$ flops.
:::

The flop count quoted in {numref}`Theorem {number} <theorem-house-flops>` dominates the running time for least-squares solution via QR. Compared to the count from {numref}`Theorem {number} <theorem-normaleqns-flops>` for solution by the normal equations, the flops are essentially identical when $m=n$, but the QR solution is about twice the cost when $m\gg n$. The redeeming quality of the QR route is better stability, which we do not discuss here.

      \cos(\theta) & \sin(\theta) \\ -\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \alpha \\ \beta
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \sqrt{\alpha^2 + \beta^2} \\ 0
    \end{bmatrix}.
    ```

    **(b)** ⌨ Given the vector $\mathbf{z}=[1\;2\;3\;4\;5]^T$, use Julia to find a sequence of Givens rotations that transforms $\mathbf{z}$ into the vector $\| \mathbf{z} \|\mathbf{e}_1$. (Hint: You can operate only on pairs of elements at a time, introducing a zero at the lower of the two positions.)
