```{admonition} About the code
:class: dropdown
Line 11 of {numref}`Function {number} <function-lufact>` points out a subtle issue. Array variables are really just references to blocks of memory. Such a reference is much more efficient to pass around than the complete contents of the array. However, it means that a statement `A_k = A` would just clone the array reference of `A` into the new variable. Any changes made to entries of `A_k` would then also be made to entries of `A`, because they refer to the same location in memory. In this context, we don't want to change the original matrix, so we use `copy` here to create an independent copy of the array contents and a new reference to them.

:open:
We create two vectors for data about the population of China. The first has the years of census data and the other has the population, in millions of people.

```{code-cell} 
year = arange(1980, 2020, 10)   # from 1980 to 2020 by 10
pop = array([984.736, 1148.364, 1263.638, 1330.141])
```

It's convenient to measure time in years since 1980. 

```{code-cell} 
t = year - 1980
y = pop
```

Now we have four data points $(t_1,y_1),\dots,(t_4,y_4)$, so $n=4$ and we seek an interpolating cubic polynomial. We construct the associated Vandermonde matrix: 

```{code-cell} 
V = vander(t)
print(V)
```

:::{index} Python; solve
:::

To solve a linear system $\mathbf{V} \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{y}$ for the vector of polynomial coefficients, we use `solve`, located in `scipy.linalg`:

```{code-cell}
from scipy import linalg
c = linalg.solve(V, y)
print(c)
```
The algorithms used by `solve` are the main topic of this chapter. As a check on the solution, we can compute the *residual* $\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{V} \mathbf{c}$, which should be small (near machine precision).

```{tip}
:class: dropdown
Matrix multiplication in NumPy is done with `@` or `matmul`.
```

```{code-cell} 
print(y - V @ c)
```

By our definitions, the coefficients in `c` are given in descending order of power in $t$. We can use the resulting polynomial to estimate the population of China in 2005:

```{code-cell} 
p = poly1d(c)          # construct a polynomial
print(p(2005 - 1980))     # apply the 1980 time shift
```

The official figure was 1303.72, so our result is rather good.

We can visualize the interpolation process. First, we plot the data as points. Then we add a plot of the interpolant, taking care to shift the $t$ variable back to actual years.

```{code-cell} 
scatter(year, y, color="k", label="data");
tt = linspace(0, 30, 300)   # 300 times from 1980 to 2010
plot(1980 + tt, p(tt), label="interpolant");
xlabel("year");
ylabel("population (millions)");

``````{dropdown} @demo-matrices
:open:
```{note}
While NumPy does have distinct representations for matrices and 2D arrays, use of the explicit matrix class is officially discouraged. We follow this advice here and use arrays to represent both matrices and vectors.
```

:::{index} ! Python; array, ! Python; shape
:::

<!-- :::{index}
see: Python; size, Python; shape
::: -->

A vector is created using square brackets and commas to enclose and separate its entries.

```{code-cell} 
x = array([3, 3, 0, 1, 0 ])
print(x.shape)
```

To construct a matrix, you nest the brackets to create a "vector of vectors". The inner vectors are the rows.

```{code-cell} 
A = array([ 
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [50, 40, 30, 20, 10], 
    [pi, sqrt(2), exp(1), (1+sqrt(5))/2, log(3)] 
    ])

print(A)
print(A.shape)
```

In this text, we treat all vectors as equivalent to matrices with a single column. That isn't true in NumPy, because even an $n \times 1$ array has two dimensions, unlike a vector.

```{code-cell} 
array([[3], [1], [2]]).shape
```

:::{index} ! Python; hstack, ! Python; vstack
:::

You can concatenate arrays with compatible dimensions using `hstack` and `vstack`.

```{code-cell} 
print( hstack([A, A]) )
```

```{code-cell} 
print( vstack([A, A]) )
```

```{index} ! Python; transpose, ! Python; adjoint
```

Transposing a matrix is done by appending `.T` to it. 

```{code-cell} 
print(A.T)
```

For matrices with complex values, we usually want instead the adjoint or hermitian, which is `.conj().T`. 

```{code-cell} 
print((x + 1j).conj().T)
```

:::{index} ! Python; arange, ! Python; linspace
:::

There are many convenient shorthand ways of building vectors and matrices other than entering all of their entries directly or in a loop. To get a vector with evenly spaced entries between two endpoints, you have two options.

```{code-cell} 
print(arange(1, 7, 2))   # from 1 to 7 (not inclusive), step by 2        
```

```{code-cell} 
print(linspace(-1, 1, 5))   # from -1 to 1 (inclusive), with 5 total values
```

The practical difference between these is whether you want to specify the step size in `arange` or the number of points in `linspace`.

Accessing an element is done by giving one (for a vector) or two index values in square brackets. **In Python, indexing always starts with zero, not 1.**

```{code-cell} 
A = array([ 
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [50, 40, 30, 20, 10], 
    linspace(-5, 5, 5) 
    ])
x = array([3, 2, 0, 1, -1 ])
```

```{code-cell} 
print("row 2, col 3 of A:", A[1, 2])
print("first element of x:", x[0])
```

```{index} ! Python; slice, ! Python; \:
```
:::{index} ! Python; indexing arrays
:::

The indices can be ranges, in which case a **slice** or block of the matrix is accessed. You build these using a colon in the form `start:stop`. However, the last value of this range is `stop-1`, not `stop`.

```{code-cell} 
print(A[1:3, 0:2])    # rows 2 and 3, cols 1 and 2
```

If `start` or `stop` is omitted, the range extends to the first or last index.

```{code-cell} 
print(x[1:])  # elements 2 through the end
```

```{code-cell} 
print(A[:2, 0])  # first two rows in column 1
```

Notice in the last case above that even when the slice is in the shape of a column vector, the result is just a vector with one dimension and neither row nor column shape.

There are more variations on the colon ranges. A negative value means to count from the end rather than the beginning. And a colon by itself means to include everything from the relevant dimension.

```{code-cell} 
print(A[:-1, :])    # all rows up to the last, all columns
```

Finally, `start:stop:step` means to step size or stride other than one. You can mix this with the other variations.

```{code-cell} 
print(x[::2])  # all the odd indexes
```

```{code-cell} 
print(A[:, ::-1])  # reverse the columns
```

The matrix and vector senses of addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication and division are all handled by the usual symbols. Two matrices of the same size (what NumPy calls shape) are operated on elementwise. 

```{code-cell} 
print(A - 2 * ones([3, 5]))  # subtract two from each element
```

```{index} ! Python; broadcast
```

If one operand has a smaller number of dimensions than the other, Python tries to **broadcast** it in the "missing" dimension(s), and the operation proceeds if the resulting shapes are identical. 

```{code-cell} 
print(A - 2)    # subtract two from each element
```

```{code-cell} 
u = array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(A - u)    # repeat this row for every row of A
```

```{code-cell} 
:tags: raises-exception
v = array([1, 2, 3])
print(A - v)  # broadcasting this would be 3x3, so it's an error
```

```{code-cell} 
print(A - v.reshape([3, 1]))    # broadcasts to each column of A
```

```{index} ! Python; \@, ! Python; matmul
```

<!-- ```{index} 
see: Python; matrix multiplication, Python; \@
``` -->

```{index} ! Python; diag
```

Matrix–matrix and matrix–vector products are computed using `@` or `matmul`.

```{code-cell} 
B = diag([-1, 0, -5])    # create a diagonal 3x3
print(B @ A)    # matrix product
```

$AB$ is undefined for these matrix sizes. 

```{code-cell} 
:tags: raises-exception
print(A @ B)    # incompatible sizes
```

```{index} ! Python; elementwise multiplication, Python; broadcasting
```

The multiplication operator `*` is reserved for elementwise multiplication. Both operands have to be the same size, after any potential broadcasts.

```{code-cell} 
:tags: raises-exception
print(B * A)    # not the same size, so it's an error
```

```{code-cell} 
print((A / 2) * A)    # elementwise
```
To raise to a power elementwise, use a double star. This will broadcast as well.

```{code-cell} 
print(B)
print(B**3)
```

```{code-cell} 
print(x)
print(2.0**x)
```

```{danger}
If `A` is a matrix, `A**2` is *not* the same as mathematically raising it to the power 2.
```


```{index} Python; broadcasting
```

Most of the mathematical functions, such as cos, sin, log, exp and sqrt, expecting scalars as operands will be broadcast to arrays.

```{code-cell} 
print(cos(pi * x))

:open:
For a square matrix $A$, the command `solve(A, B)` from `scipy.linalg` is mathematically equivalent to $\mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{b}$. 

```{code-cell} 
A = array([[1, 0, -1], [2, 2, 1], [-1, -3, 0]])
b = array([1, 2, 3])
```

```{code-cell}
from scipy import linalg
x = linalg.solve(A, b)
print(x)
```

```{index} residual
```

One way to check the answer is to compute a quantity known as the **residual**. It is (ideally) close to machine precision(relative to the elements in the data). 

```{code-cell} 
residual = b - A @ x
print(residual)
```

If the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is singular, you may get an error.

```{code-cell} 
:tags: raises-exception
A = array([[0, 1], [0, 0]])
b = array([1, -1])
linalg.solve(A, b)    # error, singular matrix
```

A linear system with a singular matrix might have no solution or infinitely many solutions, but in either case, a numerical solution becomes trickier. Detecting singularity is a lot like checking whether two floating-point numbers are *exactly* equal: because of roundoff, it could be missed. We're headed toward a more robust way to fully describe this situation.
``````

(demo-systems-triangular-python)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-systems-triangular
:open:

```{index} ! Python; tril, ! Python; triu
```

It's easy to get just the lower triangular part of any matrix using the `tril` function.

```{code-cell} 
A = 1 + floor(9 * random.rand(5, 5))
L = tril(A)
print(L)
```

We'll set up and solve a linear system with this matrix.

```{code-cell} 
b = ones(5)
x = FNC.forwardsub(L, b)
print(x)
```

It's not clear how accurate this answer is. However, the residual should be zero or comparable to $\macheps$.

```{code-cell} 
b - L @ x
```

Next we'll engineer a problem to which we know the exact answer. 

```{code-cell} 
alpha = 0.3;
beta = 2.2;
U = diag(ones(5)) + diag([-1, -1, -1, -1], k=1)
U[0, 3:5] = [ alpha - beta, beta ]
print(U)
```

```{code-cell} 
x_exact = ones(5)
b = array([alpha, 0, 0, 0, 1])
x = FNC.backsub(U, b)
print("error:", x - x_exact)
```

Everything seems OK here. But another example, with a different value for $\beta$, is more troubling.

```{code-cell} 
alpha = 0.3;
beta = 1e12;
U = diag(ones(5)) + diag([-1, -1, -1, -1], k=1)
U[0, 3:5] = [ alpha - beta, beta ]
b = array([alpha, 0, 0, 0, 1])

x = FNC.backsub(U, b)
print("error:", x - x_exact)
```

It's not so good to get 4 digits of accuracy after starting with sixteen! But the source of the error is not hard to track down. Solving for $x_1$ performs $(\alpha-\beta)+\beta$ in the first row. Since $|\alpha|$ is so much smaller than $|\beta|$, this a recipe for losing digits to subtractive cancellation.

We explore the outer product formula for two random triangular matrices.

print(L)
```

```{code-cell}

Here are the three outer products appearing in the sum in {eq}`matrixouter`:

```{code-cell}
print(outer(L[:, 0], U[0, :]))
```

```{code-cell}
print(outer(L[:, 1], U[1, :]))
```

```{code-cell}
print(outer(L[:, 2], U[2, :]))
```

Simply because of the triangular zero structures, only the first outer product contributes to the first row and first column of the entire product. 
``````


(demo-lu-derive-python)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-lu-derive
:open:
For illustration, we work on a $4 \times 4$ matrix. We name it with a subscript in preparation for what comes.

```{code-cell} 
A_1 = array([
     [2,    0,    4,    3], 
     [-4,    5,   -7,  -10], 
     [1,   15,    2,   -4.5],
     [-2,    0,    2,  -13]
        ])
L = eye(4)
U = zeros((4, 4));
```

Now we appeal to {eq}`outer-row1`. Since $L_{11}=1$, we see that the first row of $\mathbf{U}$ is just the first row of $\mathbf{A}_1$.

```{code-cell}
U[0, :] = A_1[0, :]
print(U)
```

From {eq}`outer-col1`, we see that we can find the first column of $\mathbf{L}$ from the first column of $\mathbf{A}_1$. 

```{code-cell}
L[:, 0] = A_1[:, 0] / U[0, 0]
print(L)
```

We have obtained the first term in the sum {eq}`matrixouter` for $\mathbf{L}\mathbf{U}$, and we subtract it away from $\mathbf{A}_1$.

```{code-cell}
A_2 = A_1 - outer(L[:, 0],  U[0, :])
```

Now $\mathbf{A}_2 = \boldsymbol{\ell}_2\mathbf{u}_2^T + \boldsymbol{\ell}_3\mathbf{u}_3^T + \boldsymbol{\ell}_4\mathbf{u}_4^T.$ If we ignore the first row and first column of the matrices in this equation, then in what remains we are in the same situation as at the start. Specifically, only $\boldsymbol{\ell}_2\mathbf{u}_2^T$ has any effect on the second row and column, so we can deduce them now.

```{code-cell}
U[1, :] = A_2[1, :]
L[:, 1] = A_2[:, 1] / U[1, 1]
print(L)
```
If we subtract off the latest outer product, we have a matrix that is zero in the first *two* rows and columns. 

```{code-cell}
A_3 = A_2 - outer(L[:, 1], U[1, :])
```

Now we can deal with the lower right $2\times 2$ submatrix of the remainder in a similar fashion.

```{code-cell}
U[2, :] = A_3[2, :]
L[:, 2] = A_3[:, 2] / U[2, 2]
A_4 = A_3 - outer(L[:, 2], U[2, :])
```

Finally, we pick up the last unknown in the factors.

```{code-cell}
U[3, 3] = A_4[3, 3]
```

We now have all of $\mathbf{L}$,

```{code-cell} 
print(L)
```

and all of $\mathbf{U}$,

```{code-cell}
print(U)
```

We can verify that we have a correct factorization of the original matrix by computing the backward error:

```{code-cell} 
A_1 - L @ U
```

In floating point, we cannot expect the difference to be exactly zero as we found in this toy example. Instead, we would be satisfied to see that each element of the difference above is comparable in size to machine precision.

Here is a straightforward implementation of matrix-vector multiplication.

```{code-cell} 
n = 6
A = random.rand(n, n)
x = ones(n)
y = zeros(n)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        y[i] += A[i, j] * x[j]   # 2 flops
```

Each of the loops implies a summation of flops. The total flop count for this algorithm is

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n 2 = \sum_{i=1}^n 2n = 2n^2.
$$

Since the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ has $n^2$ elements, all of which have to be involved in the product, it seems unlikely that we could get a flop count that is smaller than $O(n^2)$ in general.

Let's run an experiment with the built-in matrix-vector multiplication. We assume that flops dominate the computation time and thus measure elapsed time. 

```{code-cell} 
N = 400 * arange(1, 11)
t = []
print("  n           t")
for i, n in enumerate(N):
    A = random.randn(n, n)  
    x = random.randn(n)
    start = timer()
    for j in range(50): A @ x
    t.append(timer() - start)
    print(f"{n:5}   {t[-1]:10.3e}")
```

The reason for doing multiple repetitions at each value of $n$ above is to avoid having times so short that the resolution of the timer is a factor.

Looking at the timings just for $n=2000$ and $n=4000$, they have ratio:

```{code-cell} 
print(t[9] / t[4])
```

If the run time is dominated by flops, then we expect this ratio to be 

$$
\frac{2(4000)^2}{2(2000)^2}=4.
$$
``````


(demo-flops-loglog-python)=

Let's repeat the experiment of the previous example for more, and larger, values of $n$.

for i, n in enumerate(N):

    x = random.randn(n)
    start = timer()
    for j in range(20): A@x
    t[i] = timer() - start
```

Plotting the time as a function of $n$ on log-log scales is equivalent to plotting the logs of the variables, but is formatted more neatly.

fig, ax = subplots()
ax.loglog(N, t, "-o", label="observed")

You can see that while the full story is complicated, the graph is trending to a straight line of positive slope. For comparison, we can plot a line that represents $O(n^2)$ growth exactly. (All such lines have slope equal to 2.)

We now find the largest candidate pivot in the first column. We don't care about sign, so we take absolute values before finding the max.
```{tip}
:class: dropdown
The `argmax` function returns the location of the largest element of a vector or matrix.
```


```{code-cell}
i = argmax( abs(A_1[:, 0]) )
print(i)
```

This is the row of the matrix that we extract to put into $\mathbf{U}$. That guarantees that the division used to find $\boldsymbol{\ell}_1$ will be valid.

```{code-cell}
L, U = eye(4), zeros((4, 4))
U[0, :] = A_1[i, :]
L[:, 0] = A_1[:, 0] / U[0, 0]
A_2 = A_1 - outer(L[:, 0], U[0, :])
print(A_2)
```

Observe that $\mathbf{A}_2$ has a new zero row and zero column, but the zero row is the fourth rather than the first. However, we forge on by using the largest possible pivot in column 2 for the next outer product.

```{code-cell}
i = argmax( abs(A_2[:, 1]) ) 
print(f"new pivot row is {i}")
U[1, :] = A_2[i, :]
L[:, 1] = A_2[:, 1] / U[1, 1]
A_3 = A_2 - outer(L[:, 1], U[1, :])
print(A_3)
```
Now we have zeroed out the third row as well as the second column. We can finish out the procedure.

```{code-cell}
i = argmax( abs(A_3[:, 2]) ) 
print(f"new pivot row is {i}")
U[2, :] = A_3[i, :]
L[:, 2] = A_3[:, 2] / U[2, 2]
A_4 = A_3 - outer(L[:, 2], U[2, :])
print(A_4)
```

```{code-cell}
i = argmax( abs(A_4[:, 3]) ) 
print(f"new pivot row is {i}")
U[3, :] = A_4[i, :]
L[:, 3] = A_4[:, 3] / U[3, 3];
```

We do have a factorization of the original matrix:

```{code-cell}
A_1 - L @ U
```

And $\mathbf{U}$ has the required structure:

```{code-cell}
print(U)
```

However, the triangularity of $\mathbf{L}$ has been broken.

In `scipy.solve`, the matrix `A` is PLU-factored, followed by two triangular solves. If we want to do those steps seamlessly, we can use `lu_factor` and `lu_solve`.

Why would we ever bother with this? In {numref}`section-linsys-efficiency` we showed that the factorization is by far the most costly part of the solution process. A factorization object allows us to do that costly step only once per matrix, but solve with multiple right-hand sides.

We can factor the matrix without pivoting and solve for $\mathbf{x}$.

Note that we have obtained only about 5 accurate digits for $x_1$. We could make the result even more inaccurate by making $\epsilon$ even smaller:

The `norm` function from `numpy.linalg` computes vector norms.

```{code-cell} 
from numpy.linalg import norm
x = array([2, -3, 1, -1])
print(norm(x))       # 2-norm by default
```

```{code-cell} 
print(norm(x, inf))

:open:
```{code-cell} 
from numpy.linalg import norm
A = array([ [2, 0], [1, -1] ])
```

```{index} ! Python; norm
```

The default matrix norm is *not* the 2-norm. Instead, you must provide the 2 explicitly. 

```{code-cell} 
print(norm(A, 2))
```

You can get the 1-norm as well.

```{code-cell} 
print(norm(A, 1))
```

```{index} ! Python; max, Python; sum
```

The 1-norm is equivalent to 

```{code-cell} 
print(max( sum(abs(A), axis=0)) )  # sum down the rows
```

Similarly, we can get the $\infty$-norm and check our formula for it.

```{code-cell} 
print(norm(A, inf))
```

```{code-cell} 
print(max( sum(abs(A), axis=1)) )  # sum across columns 
```

Here we illustrate the geometric interpretation of the 2-norm. First, we will sample a lot of vectors on the unit circle in $\mathbb{R}^2$. 

```{code-cell} 
theta = linspace(0, 2*pi, 601)
x = vstack([cos(theta), sin(theta)])  # 601 unit columns
```

The linear function $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$ defines a mapping from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$. We can apply `A` to every column of `x` simply by using a matrix multiplication.

```{code-cell} 
y = A @ x
```

We plot the unit circle on the left and the image of all mapped vectors on the right: 

```{code-cell} 
subplot(1,2,1)
plot(x[0, :], x[1, :])
axis("equal")
title("Unit circle")
xlabel("$x_1$")
ylabel("$x_2$")

subplot(1,2,2)
plot(y[0, :], y[1, :])
plot(norm(A, 2) * x[0, :], norm(A,2) * x[1, :],"--")
axis("equal")
title("Image under map")
xlabel("$y_1$")
ylabel("$y_2$");
```

As seen on the right-side plot, the image of the transformed vectors is an ellipse that just touches the circle of radius $\|\mathbf{A}\|_2$.

### 2.8 @section-linsys-condition-number
(demo-condition-bound-python)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-condition-bound
:open:

```{index} ! Python; cond
```

The function `cond` from `numpy.linalg` is used to computes matrix condition numbers. By default, the 2-norm is used. As an example, the family of *Hilbert matrices* is famously badly conditioned. Here is the $6\times 6$  case. 

```{code-cell} 
A = array([ 
    [1/(i + j + 2) for j in range(6)] 
    for i in range(6) 
    ])
print(A)
```

```{code-cell} 
from numpy.linalg import cond
kappa = cond(A)
print(f"kappa is {kappa:.3e}")
```

Next we engineer a linear system problem to which we know the exact answer.

```{code-cell} 
x_exact = 1.0 + arange(6)
b = A @ x_exact
```

Now we perturb the data randomly with a vector of norm $10^{-12}$. 

```{code-cell} 
dA = random.randn(6, 6)
dA = 1e-12 * (dA / norm(dA, 2))
db = random.randn(6)
db = 1e-12 * (db / norm(db, 2))
```

We solve the perturbed problem using built-in pivoted LU and see how the solution was changed.

```{code-cell} 
from scipy import linalg
x = linalg.solve(A + dA, b + db) 
dx = x - x_exact
```

Here is the relative error in the solution.

```{code-cell} 
print(f"relative error is {norm(dx) / norm(x_exact):.2e}")
```

And here are upper bounds predicted using the condition number of the original matrix. 

```{code-cell} 
print(f"b_bound: {kappa * 1e-12 / norm(b):.2e}")
print(f"A_bound: {kappa * 1e-12 / norm(A, 2):.2e}")
```

Even if we don't make any manual perturbations to the data, machine epsilon does when we solve the linear system numerically.

```{code-cell}
from scipy import linalg
x = linalg.solve(A, b)
print(f"relative error: {norm(x - x_exact) / norm(x_exact):.2e}")
print(f"rounding bound: {kappa / 2**52:.2e}")

```

Because $\kappa\approx 10^8$, it's possible to lose 8 digits of accuracy in the process of passing from $A$ and $b$ to $x$. That's independent of the algorithm; it's inevitable once the data are expressed in double precision. 

Larger Hilbert matrices are even more poorly conditioned.

```{code-cell} 
A = array([ [1/(i+j+2) for j in range(14)] for i in range(14) ])
kappa = cond(A)
print(f"kappa is {kappa:.3e}")
```

Before we compute the solution, note that $\kappa$ exceeds `1/eps`. In principle we therefore might end up with an answer that is completely wrong (i.e., a relative error greater than 100%).

```{code-cell} 
print(f"rounding bound: {kappa / 2**52:.2e}")
```

```{code-cell} 
x_exact = 1.0 + arange(14)
b = A @ x_exact  
x = linalg.solve(A, b)
```

We got an answer. But in fact, the error does exceed 100%:

```{code-cell} 
print(f"relative error: {norm(x - x_exact) / norm(x_exact):.2e}")
```

We can extract the elements on any diagonal using the `diag` command. The "main" or central diagonal is numbered zero, above and to the right of that is positive, and below and to the left is negative.

```{code-cell} 
print( diag(A, 1) )

```{code-cell}

print(A)
```

```{code-cell} 
L, U = FNC.lufact(A)

    [2,    -5,     2,   -26]
    ])
```

We won't use pivoting, so the pivot element is at position (1,1). This will become the first element on the diagonal of $\mathbf{D}$. Then we divide by that pivot to get the first column of $\mathbf{L}$.

```{code-cell}
L = eye(4)
d = zeros(4)
d[0] = A_1[0, 0]
L[:, 0] = A_1[:, 0] / d[0]
A_2 = A_1 - d[0] * outer(L[:, 0], L[:, 0])
print(A_2)
```
We are now set up the same way for the submatrix in rows and columns 2–4.

```{code-cell}
d[1] = A_2[1, 1]
L[:, 1] = A_2[:, 1] / d[1]
A_3 = A_2 - d[1] * outer(L[:, 1], L[:, 1])
print(A_3)
```

We continue working our way down the diagonal.

```{code-cell}
d[2] = A_3[2, 2]
L[:, 2] = A_3[:, 2] / d[2]
A_4 = A_3 - d[2] * outer(L[:, 2], L[:, 2])
print(A_4)

We have arrived at the desired factorization.

```{code-cell}
d[3] = A_4[3, 3]
print("diagonal of D:")
print(d)
print("L:")
print(L)

This should be comparable to machine roundoff:
