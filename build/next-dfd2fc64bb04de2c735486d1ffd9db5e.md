Details on the computation of the eigenvalue and singular value decompositions are presented at length in {cite}`stewartMatrixAlgorithms2001` and more briefly in Chapters 7 and 8 of {cite}`golubMatrixComputations1996`. A classic reference on the particulars of the symmetric case is {cite}`parlettSymmetricEigenvalue1980`, while {cite}`trefethenSpectraPseudospectra2005` focuses on the non-normal case. Dimension reduction via the SVD often goes by the name *principal component analysis*, which is the subject of {cite}`jolliffePrincipalComponent2002`.
