# The wave equation

```{index} ! wave equation
```

Closely related to the advection equation is the **wave equation**,

:::{math}
:label: wavepde
    u_{tt} - c^2 u_{xx} = 0.
:::

This is our first PDE having a second derivative in time. As in the advection equation, $u(x,t)=\phi(x-ct)$ is a solution of {eq}`wavepde`, but now so is $u(x,t)=\phi(x+c t)$ for any twice-differentiable $\phi$ (see @problem-wave-twodir). Thus, the wave equation supports advection in both directions simultaneously. 

We will use $x \in [0,1]$ and $t>0$ as the domain. Because $u$ has two derivatives in $t$ and in $x$, we need two boundary conditions. We will use the Dirichlet conditions  

:::{math}
:label: waveBC
u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0, \qquad t \ge 0,
:::

and two initial conditions,

:::{math}
:label: waveIC
\begin{split}
u(x,0) &= f(x), \qquad 0 \le x \le 1,  \\
u_t(x,0) &= g(x), \qquad 0 \le x \le 1. 
\end{split}
:::

One approach is to discretize both the $u_{tt}$ and $u_{xx}$ terms using finite differences:

$$
\frac{1}{\tau^2}(U_{i,j+1} - 2U_{i,j} + U_{i,j-1}) = \frac{c^2}{h^2}
(U_{i+1,j} - 2U_{i,j} + U_{i-1,j}).
$$

This equation can be rearranged to solve for $U_{i,j+1}$ in terms of values at time levels $j$ and $j-1$. Rather than pursue this method, however, we will turn to the method of lines.

## First-order system

In order to be compatible with the standard IVP solvers that we have encountered, we must recast {eq}`wavepde` as a first-order system in time. Using our typical methodology, we would define $y=u_t$ and derive

:::{math}
:label: wavefirst1
\begin{split}
  u_t &= y, \\
  y_t &= c^2 u_{xx}.
\end{split}
:::

However, there is another, less obvious option for reducing to a first-order system:

:::{math}
:label: wavefirst2
\begin{split}
    u_t &= z_x, \\
    z_t &= c^2 u_{x}.
\end{split}
:::

```{index} Maxwell's equations
```

This second form is appealing in part because it's equivalent to Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism. In the Maxwell form we typically replace the velocity initial condition in {eq}`waveIC` with a condition on $z$, which may be physically more relevant in some applications:

:::{math}
:label: waveIC2
\begin{split}
u(x,0) &= f(x), \qquad 0 \le x \le 1,  \\
z(x,0) &= g(x), \qquad 0 \le x \le 1.
\end{split}
:::

Because waves travel in both directions, there is no preferred upwind direction. This makes a centered finite difference in space appropriate. Before application of the boundary conditions, semidiscretization of {eq}`wavefirst2` leads to

:::{math}
:label: waveMOL
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{u}'(t) \\[2mm]  \mathbf{z}'(t)
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \boldsymbol{0} & \mathbf{D}_x \\[2mm] c^2 \mathbf{D}_x & \boldsymbol{0}
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{u}(t) \\[2mm] \mathbf{z}(t)
  \end{bmatrix}.
:::

The boundary conditions {eq}`waveBC` suggest that we should remove both of the end values of $\mathbf{u}$ from the discretization, but retain all of the $\mathbf{z}$ values. We use $\mathbf{w}(t)$ to denote the vector of all the unknowns in the semidiscretization. When computing $\mathbf{w}'(t)$, we extract the $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{z}$ components, and we use dedicated functions for padding with the zero end values or chopping off the zeros as necessary.

## Variable speed

An interesting situation is when the wave speed $c$ changes discontinuously, as when light passes from one material into another. For this we must replace the term $c^2$ in {eq}`waveMOL` with the matrix $\operatorname{diag}\bigl(c^2(x_0),\ldots,c^2(x_m)\bigr)$.

(demo-wave-speed)=
::::{prf:example} Wave equation with variable speed

We now use a wave speed that is discontinuous at $x=0$; to the left, $c=1$, and to the right, $c=2$.

``````{exercise}
:label: problem-wave-neumann
⌨ Suppose the wave equation has homogeneous Neumann conditions on $u$ at each boundary instead of Dirichlet conditions. Using the Maxwell formulation {eq}`wavefirst2`, we have $z_t=c^2u_x$, so $z$ is constant in time at each boundary. Therefore, the endpoint values of $\mathbf{z}$ can be taken from the initial condition and removed from the ODE, while the entire $\mathbf{u}$ vector is now part of the ODE.
