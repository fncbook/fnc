# Fixed-point iteration

In this section, we consider the alternative form of the rootfinding problem known as the *fixed-point problem*.

```{index} ! fixed-point problem
```
```{prf:definition} Fixed-point problem
Given a function $g$, the **fixed-point problem** is to find a value $p$, called a **fixed point**, such that $g(p)=p$.
```

Given $f$ for rootfinding, we could define $g(x)=x-f(x)$, and then $f(r)=0$ implies $g(r)=r$ and vice versa. There are infinitely many ways to make this transformation, such as $g(x)=x+cf(x)$ for any constant $c$. The process can be reversed, too. Given $g(x)$, we could define $f(x)=x-g(x)$, and then $g(p)=p$ implies $f(p)=0$.


There is an extraordinarily simple way to try to find a fixed point of any given $g(x)$.

```{index} ! fixed-point iteration
```

```{prf:algorithm} Fixed-point iteration
Given function $g$ and initial value $x_1$, define
```{math}
:label: fixedpointiter
  x_{k+1} = g(x_k), \qquad k=1,2,\ldots.
```

This is our first example of an iterative algorithm that never quite gets to the answer, even if we use exact numbers. The idea is to generate a sequence of values that one hopes will converge to the correct result, and stop when we are satisfied that we are close enough to the limit.

## Series analysis

In {numref}`Demo %s <demo-fp-spiral>`, the two computed iterations differ only in the choice of $x_1$. In the first case we evidently generated a sequence that converged to one of the fixed points. In the second case, however, the generated sequence diverged.[^finsample] The easiest way to uncover the essential difference between the two cases is to use a Taylor series expansion.

[^finsample]: We can only ever generate a finite sample from an infinite sequence, which in principle does not guarantee anything whatsoever about the limit or divergence of that sequence. However, in practical computing one usually assumes that well-established trends in the sequence will continue, and we complement observed experience with rigorous theory where possible.

Suppose a fixed point $p$ is the desired limit of an iteration $x_1,x_2,\ldots$. It's often easier to express quantities in terms of the error sequence $\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2,\ldots,$ where $\epsilon_k=x_k-p$. Starting from {eq}`fixedpointiter`, we have

```{math}
\begin{split}
  \epsilon_{k+1}+p = g( \epsilon_{k}+p ) = g(p) + g'(p) \epsilon_k + \frac{1}{2}g''(p) \epsilon_k^2 + \cdots,
\end{split}
```

assuming that $g$ has at least two continuous derivatives. But by definition, $g(p)=p$, so

```{math}
:label: fpconverge
  \epsilon_{k+1} = g'(p) \epsilon_k + O(\epsilon_k^2).
```

If the iteration is to converge to $p$, the errors must approach zero. In this case we can neglect the second-order term and conclude that $\epsilon_{k+1} \approx g'(p) \epsilon_k$. This is consistent with convergence if $|g'(p)|<1$. However, if $|g'(p)| >1$, we are led to the conclusion that the errors must grow, not vanish, even if they start quite small.

```{prf:observation}
Fixed point iteration for a differentiable $g(x)$ converges to a fixed point $p$ if the initial error is sufficiently small and $|g'(p)|< 1$. The iteration diverges for all initial values if $|g'(p)| > 1$.
```

(example-fprate)=
````{prf:example}
The role of $g'(p)$ is clear in {numref}`Demo %s <demo-fp-spiral>`. We have $g(x) = -x^2+5x-3.5$ and $g'(x)=-2x+5$. For the first fixed point, near $2.71$, we get $g'(p)\approx-0.42$, indicating convergence. For the second fixed point, near 1.29, we get $g'(p)\approx 2.42$, which is consistent with the observed divergence.
````

## Linear convergence

In computation we usually want to know not just whether an iteration converges but also the rate at which convergence occurs, i.e., how quickly the errors approach zero. Other things being equal, faster convergence is preferred to slower convergence, as it usually implies that the computation will take less time to achieve a desired accuracy.

The prediction of the series analysis above is that if the fixed point iteration converges, the errors approximately satisfy $|\epsilon_{k+1}| = \sigma|\epsilon_k|$, for $\sigma = |g'(p)| < 1$. This is a well-known type of convergence.

```{index} ! convergence rate; linear, ! linear convergence
```

````{prf:definition} Linear convergence
Suppose a sequence $x_k$ approaches limit $x^*$. If the error sequence $\epsilon_k=x_k - x^*$ satisfies

```{math}
:label: linearconvergence
  \lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{|\epsilon_{k+1}|}{|\epsilon_k|} = \sigma < 1,
```

then the sequence displays **linear convergence**. The number $\sigma$ is called the **convergence rate**.
````

If we suppose that the ratios in {eq}`linearconvergence` all equal $\sigma$ (i.e., perfect linear convergence), then $|\epsilon_k| = C \sigma^k$. Taking logs, we get

```{math}
  \log |\epsilon_k| = k(\log \sigma) + (\log C).
```

This is in the form $\log |\epsilon_k| = \alpha k + \beta$, which is a linear relationship.

```{prf:observation} Linear convergence in practice
Linear convergence is marked by an approximate reduction of the error at each iteration by a constant factor, the convergence rate $\sigma$. When graphed on a log-linear scale, the errors lie on a straight line whose slope is the log of the convergence rate. Both phenomena manifest most strongly at the latest iterations.

## Contraction maps

The convergence condition $\sigma=|g'(p)|<1$ derived by series expansion is a special case of a more general condition.

```{index} ! Lipschitz condition
```

````{prf:definition}
A function $g$ is said to satisfy a **Lipschitz condition** with constant $L$ on the interval $S\subset\mathbb{R}$ if, for all $s,t\in S$, 
  
```{math}
:label: lipschitz
    \bigl| g(s)-g(t) \bigr| \le L \bigl| s-t \bigr|.
```
````

```{index} ! contraction mapping
```

It can be shown that a function satisfying {eq}`lipschitz` is continuous in $S$. If $L<1$, we call $g$ a **contraction mapping** because distances between points all decrease after an application of $g$. This situation leads to a major result about fixed points.

(theorem-contraction)=
````{prf:theorem} Contraction mapping
Suppose that $g$ satisfies {eq}`lipschitz` with $L<1$ on an interval $S$. Then $S$ contains exactly one fixed point $p$ of $g$. If $x_1,x_2,\ldots$ are generated by the fixed point iteration {eq}`fixedpointiter`, and $x_1,x_2,\ldots$ all lie in $S$, then $|x_k-p|\le L^{k-1} |x_1-p|$ for all $k>1$.
````

````{prf:proof}
(partial proof)  First we show there is at most one fixed point in $S$. Suppose $g(t)=t$ and $g(s)=s$ in $S$. Then by {eq}`lipschitz`, $|s-t|=|g(s)-g(t)|\le L|s-t|$, which for $L<1$ is possible only if $|s-t|=0$, so $s=t$.

Now suppose that for some $p\in S$, $g(p)=p$. By the definition of the fixed point iteration and the Lipschitz condition,
  
```{math}
|x_{k+1} - p | = |g(x_k) - g(p)| \le L |x_k-p|,
```

which shows that $x_k\to p$ as $k\to \infty$. To show that $p$ must exist and complete the proof, one needs to apply the Cauchy theory of convergence of a sequence, which is beyond the scope of this text.
````

From the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which asserts that $g(s)-g(t)=\int_s^t g'(x)\, dx$, it's easy to conclude that an upper bound of $|g'(x)|\le L$ for all $x$ results in {eq}`lipschitz`. Hence:

::::{prf:corollary}
If $|g'(x)|\le L < 1$ for all $x$ in an interval $S$, then the conclusions of {numref}`Theorem {number} <theorem-contraction>` apply.
::::

There are stronger and more general statements of {numref}`Theorem %s <theorem-contraction>`. For instance, it's possible to show that all initial $x_1$ that are sufficiently close to the fixed point will lead to convergence of the iteration. Algorithmically the main virtue of the fixed point iteration is that it is incredibly easy to apply. However, as we are about to discover, it's far from the fastest option.
