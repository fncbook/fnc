# Sparsity and structure

```{index} ! sparse matrix
```

Very large matrices cannot be stored all within primary memory of a computer unless they are **sparse**. A sparse matrix has *structural zeros*, meaning entries that are known to be exactly zero.} For instance, the adjacency matrix of a graph has zeros where there are no links in the graph. To store and operate with a sparse matrix efficiently, it is not represented as an array of all of its values. There is a variety of sparse formats available; for the most part, you can imagine that the matrix is stored as triples $(i,j,A_{ij})$ for all the nonzero $(i,j)$ locations.

## Computing with sparse matrices

```{index} adjacency matrix
```

Most graphs with real applications have many fewer edges than the maximum possible $n^2$ for $n$ nodes. Accordingly, their adjacency matrices have mostly zero elements and should be represented sparsely.

```{index} fill-in of sparse matrices
```

Arithmetic operations such as `+`, `-`, `*`, and `^` respect and exploit sparsity if the matrix operands are sparse. However, matrix operations may substantially decrease the amount of sparsity, a phenomenon known as **fill-in**.

## Banded matrices

```{index} banded matrix
```

A particularly important type of sparse matrix is a banded matrix. Recall from {numref}`section-linsys-structure` that $\mathbf{A}$ has **upper bandwidth** $p$ if $j-i > p$ implies $A_{ij}=0$, and **lower bandwidth** $q$ if $i-j > q$ implies $A_{ij}=0$. We say the total **bandwidth** is $p+q+1$. Banded matrices appear naturally in many applications where each element interacts directly with only a few neighbors. 

```{index} LU factorization
```

Without pivoting, an LU factorization preserves bandwidth, but pivoting can change or destroy bandedness.

## Systems and eigenvalues

If given a sparse matrix, the backslash operator will automatically try a form of sparse-aware Cholesky or pivoted LU factorization. Depending on the sparsity pattern of the matrix, the time taken to solve the linear system may be well below the $O(n^3)$ needed in the general case.

```{index} eigenvalue decomposition
```

For very large matrices, it's unlikely that you will want to find all of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In {numref}`section-krylov-subspace` we describe some of the math behind an algorithm that can find a selected number of eigenvalues of largest magnitude, lying to the extreme left or right, or nearest a given complex number.
