The spacing between floating-point values in $[2^n,2^{n+1})$ is $2^n \epsilon_\text{mach}$, where $\epsilon_\text{mach}$ is machine epsilon. Its value is predefined as `eps`.

:::{card}
:columns: 6
While you can assign a different value to `eps`, doing so does not change any arithmetic. It's generally a bad idea. 
:::
::::

```{code-cell} 
eps
```

Because double precision allocates 52 bits to the significand, the default value of machine epsilon is $2^{-52}$.

```{code-cell}
log2(eps)
```

The spacing between adjacent floating-point values is proportional to the magnitude of the value itself. This is how relative precision is kept roughly constant throughout the range of values. You can get the adjusted spacing by calling `eps` with a value.

```{code-cell}
eps(1.618)
```

```{code-cell}
eps(161.8)
```

```{code-cell}
x = 161.8 + 0.6*eps(161.8);
x - 161.8
```

A common mistake is to think that $\epsilon_\text{mach}$ is the smallest floating-point number. It's only the smallest *relative to 1*. The correct perspective is that the scaling of values is limited by the exponent, not the mantissa. The actual range of positive values in double precision is

```{code-cell}
[realmin, realmax]
```

(demo-float-arithmetic-matlab)=

There is no double-precision number between $1$ and $1+\epsilon_\text{mach}$. Thus the following difference is zero despite its appearance.

```{code-cell}
( 1 + eps/2 ) - 1
```

However, the spacing between floats in $[1/2,1)$ is $\macheps/2$, so both $1-\macheps/2$ and its negative are represented exactly:

```{code-cell}
1 + ( eps/2 - 1 )
```

This is now the expected result. But we have found a rather shocking breakdown of the associative law of addition!

(demo-condition-roots-matlab)=
``````{dropdown} Conditioning of polynomial roots
:open: false

The polynomial $p(x) = \frac{1}{3}(x-1)(x-1-\epsilon)$ has roots $1$ and $1+\epsilon$. For small values of $\epsilon$, the roots are ill-conditioned. 


```{code-cell} matlab
ep = 1e-6 
a = 1/3;             % coefficients of p...
b = (-2 - ep) / 3;   % ...
c = (1 + ep) / 3;    % ...in ascending order
```

Here are the roots as computed by the quadratic formula.

```{code-cell}
d = sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c);
format long   % show all digits
r1 = (-b - d) / 2*a
r2 = (-b + d) / 2*a
```

The display of `r2` suggests that the last five digits or so are inaccurate. The relative error in the value is 

```{code-cell}
abs(r2 - (1 + ep)) / (1 + ep)
```

The condition number of the roots is inversely proportional to $2\epsilon$, the difference between them. Thus, roundoff error in the data can grow in the result to be roughly

```{code-cell}
eps / ep
```

This matches the observation well.

We apply the quadratic formula to find the roots of a quadratic via {eq}`quadunstable`. 

:::{card}
A number in scientific notation is entered as `1.23e4` rather than as `1.23 * 10^4`.
:::
::::

```{code-cell}
a = 1;  b = -(1e6 + 1e-6);  c = 1;
x1 = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / 2*a
x2 = (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / 2*a
```

The first value is correct to all stored digits, but the second has fewer than six accurate digits:

```{code-cell}
error = abs(1e-6 - x2) / 1e-6 
accurate_digits = -log10(error)
```

 The instability is easily explained. Since $a=c=1$, we treat them as exact numbers. First, we compute the condition numbers with respect to $b$ for each elementary step in finding the "good" root:

| Calculation | Result | $\kappa$ |
|:------------|:-------|:---------|
|$u_1 = b^2$  | $1.000000000002000\times 10^{12}$ |  2 |
|$u_2 = u_1 - 4$ | $9.999999999980000\times 10^{11}$  | $\approx 1.00$ |
|$u_3 = \sqrt{u_2}$ | $999999.9999990000$ | 1/2 |
|$u_4 = u_3 - b$ | $2000000$ | $\approx 0.500$ |
|$u_5 = u_4/2$ | $1000000$  | 1 |

Using {eq}`condition-chain`, the chain rule for condition numbers, the conditioning of the entire chain is the product of the individual steps, so there is essentially no growth of relative error here. However, if we use the quadratic formula for the "bad" root, the next-to-last step becomes $u_4=(-u_3) - b$, and now  $\kappa=|u_3|/|u_4|\approx 5\times 10^{11}$. So we can expect to lose 11 digits of accuracy, which is what we observed. The key issue is the subtractive cancellation in this one step.

First, we find the "good" root using the quadratic formula.

Then we use the identity $x_1x_2=\frac{c}{a}$ to compute the smaller root:

```{code-cell}
x2 = c / (a*x1)

To be sure we have an accurate result, we compute its relative error.

(demo-stability-roots-matlab)=
````{dropdown} Backward error
:open: false

Our first step is to construct a polynomial with six known roots.

```{code-cell}
r = [-2 ,-1, 1, 1, 3, 6];
p = poly(r)
```

Now we use a standard numerical method for finding those roots, pretending that we don't know them already. This corresponds to $\tilde{y}$ in {numref}`Definition {number} <definition-stability-backward>`. 

```{code-cell}
rr = sort(roots(p))   
```

Here are the relative errors in each of the computed roots. 


```{code-cell}
disp("Root errors:") 
abs(r - rr) / r
```

It seems that the forward error is acceptably close to machine epsilon for double precision in all cases except the double root at $x=1$. This is not a surprise, though, given the poor conditioning at such roots.

Let's consider the backward error. The data in the rootfinding problem is the polynomial coefficients. We can apply `poly` to find the coefficients of the polynomial (that is, the data) whose roots were actually computed by the numerical algorithm. This corresponds to $\tilde{x}$ in {numref}`Definition {number} <definition-stability-backward>`. 

```{code-cell}
pp = poly(rr)
```

We find that in a relative sense, these coefficients are very close to those of the original, exact polynomial:

```{code-cell}
c = coeffs(p); cc = coeffs(pp);
disp("Coefficient errors:") 
abs(c - cc) / c
```

In summary, even though there are some computed roots relatively far from their correct values, they are nevertheless the roots of a polynomial that is very close to the original.
