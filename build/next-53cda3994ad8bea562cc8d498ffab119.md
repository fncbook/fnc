We use Runge-Kutta methods as a class to represent what are also called single-step or one-step methods. A gentle introduction to these and other kinds of IVP methods can be found in Atkinson and Han {cite}`atkinsonIntroductionNumerical1989`. More advanced introductions are given in Corless and Fillon {cite}`corlessGraduateIntroduction2013` and Iserles {cite}`iserlesFirstCourse1996`. The most definitive reference is by Hairer et al. {cite}`hairerSolvingOrdinary2008`.

A dated but still interesting article about the built-in functions for solving initial value problems in MATLAB is by Shampine {cite}`shampineMATLABODE1997`. Methods for a more general type of problem known as **differentialâ€“algebraic equations** are covered in Brenan *et al.* {cite}`brenanNumericalSolution1996`.

Interesting history of IVP methods can be found at
[the SIAM website](http://history.siam.org), where C. W. Gear gives both an [oral history](http://history.siam.org/oralhistories/gear.htm) and an [article](http://history.siam.org/pdf/cwgear.pdf) reprinted from {cite}`nashHistoryScientific1990`.
