``````{dropdown} Linear system for polynomial interpolation
We create two vectors for data about the population of China. The first has the years of census data and the other has the population, in millions of people.

```{code-cell} ipython3
year = arange(1980, 2020, 10)   # from 1980 to 2020 by 10
pop = array([984.736, 1148.364, 1263.638, 1330.141])
```

It's convenient to measure time in years since 1980. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
t = year - 1980
y = pop
```

Now we have four data points $(t_1,y_1),\dots,(t_4,y_4)$, so $n=4$ and we seek an interpolating cubic polynomial. We construct the associated Vandermonde matrix: 

```{code-cell} ipython3
V = vander(t)
print(V)
```

To solve a linear system $\mathbf{V} \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{y}$ for the vector of polynomial coefficients, we use `solve` (imported from `numpy.linalg`):

```{code-cell} ipython3
c = solve(V, y)
print(c)
```
::::{grid} 1 1 2 2
The algorithms used by `solve` are the main topic of this chapter. As a check on the solution, we can compute the *residual* $\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{V} \mathbf{c}$, which should be small (near machine precision).

:::{card}
Matrix multiplication in NumPy is done with `@` or `matmul`.
:::
::::

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(y - V @ c)
```

By our definitions, the coefficients in `c` are given in descending order of power in $t$. We can use the resulting polynomial to estimate the population of China in 2005:

```{code-cell} ipython3
p = poly1d(c)          # construct a polynomial
print(p(2005 - 1980))     # apply the 1980 time shift
```

The official figure was 1303.72, so our result is rather good.

We can visualize the interpolation process. First, we plot the data as points. Then we add a plot of the interpolant, taking care to shift the $t$ variable back to actual years.

```{code-cell} ipython3
scatter(year, y, color="k", label="data");
tt = linspace(0, 30, 300)   # 300 times from 1980 to 2010
plot(1980 + tt, p(tt), label="interpolant");
xlabel("year");
ylabel("population (millions)");

```{note}
While NumPy does have distinct representations for matrices and 2D arrays, use of the explicit matrix class is officially discouraged. We follow this advice here and use arrays to represent both matrices and vectors.
```

:::{index} ! Python; array, ! Python; shape
:::

<!-- :::{index}
see: Python; size, Python; shape
::: -->

A vector is created using square brackets and commas to enclose and separate its entries.

```{code-cell} ipython3
x = array([3, 3, 0, 1, 0 ])
print(x.shape)
```

To construct a matrix, you nest the brackets to create a "vector of vectors". The inner vectors are the rows.

```{code-cell} ipython3
A = array([ 
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [50, 40, 30, 20, 10], 
    [pi, sqrt(2), exp(1), (1+sqrt(5))/2, log(3)] 
    ])

print(A)
print(A.shape)
```

In this text, we treat all vectors as equivalent to matrices with a single column. That isn't true in NumPy, because even an $n \times 1$ array has two dimensions, unlike a vector.

```{code-cell} ipython3
array([[3], [1], [2]]).shape
```

:::{index} ! Python; hstack, ! Python; vstack
:::

You can concatenate arrays with compatible dimensions using `hstack` and `vstack`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print( hstack([A, A]) )
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print( vstack([A, A]) )
```

```{index} ! Python; transpose, ! Python; adjoint
```

Transposing a matrix is done by appending `.T` to it. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(A.T)
```

For matrices with complex values, we usually want instead the adjoint or hermitian, which is `.conj().T`. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
print((x + 1j).conj().T)
```

:::{index} ! Python; arange, ! Python; linspace
:::

There are many convenient shorthand ways of building vectors and matrices other than entering all of their entries directly or in a loop. To get a vector with evenly spaced entries between two endpoints, you have two options.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(arange(1, 7, 2))   # from 1 to 7 (not inclusive), step by 2        
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(linspace(-1, 1, 5))   # from -1 to 1 (inclusive), with 5 total values
```

The practical difference between these is whether you want to specify the step size in `arange` or the number of points in `linspace`.

Accessing an element is done by giving one (for a vector) or two index values in square brackets. **In Python, indexing always starts with zero, not 1.**

```{code-cell} ipython3
A = array([ 
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [50, 40, 30, 20, 10], 
    linspace(-5, 5, 5) 
    ])
x = array([3, 2, 0, 1, -1 ])
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print("row 2, col 3 of A:", A[1, 2])
print("first element of x:", x[0])
```

```{index} ! Python; slice, ! Python; \:
```
:::{index} ! Python; indexing arrays
:::

The indices can be ranges, in which case a **slice** or block of the matrix is accessed. You build these using a colon in the form `start:stop`. However, the last value of this range is `stop-1`, not `stop`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(A[1:3, 0:2])    # rows 2 and 3, cols 1 and 2
```

If `start` or `stop` is omitted, the range extends to the first or last index.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(x[1:])  # elements 2 through the end
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(A[:2, 0])  # first two rows in column 1
```

Notice in the last case above that even when the slice is in the shape of a column vector, the result is just a vector with one dimension and neither row nor column shape.

There are more variations on the colon ranges. A negative value means to count from the end rather than the beginning. And a colon by itself means to include everything from the relevant dimension.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(A[:-1, :])    # all rows up to the last, all columns
```

Finally, `start:stop:step` means to step size or stride other than one. You can mix this with the other variations.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(x[::2])  # all the odd indexes
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(A[:, ::-1])  # reverse the columns
```

The matrix and vector senses of addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication and division are all handled by the usual symbols. Two matrices of the same size (what NumPy calls shape) are operated on elementwise. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(A - 2 * ones([3, 5]))  # subtract two from each element
```

```{index} ! Python; broadcast
```

If one operand has a smaller number of dimensions than the other, Python tries to **broadcast** it in the "missing" dimension(s), and the operation proceeds if the resulting shapes are identical. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(A - 2)    # subtract two from each element
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
u = array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(A - u)    # repeat this row for every row of A
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: raises-exception
v = array([1, 2, 3])
print(A - v)  # broadcasting this would be 3x3, so it's an error
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(A - v.reshape([3, 1]))    # broadcasts to each column of A
```

```{index} ! Python; \@, ! Python; matmul
```

<!-- ```{index} 
see: Python; matrix multiplication, Python; \@
``` -->

```{index} ! Python; diag
```

Matrix–matrix and matrix–vector products are computed using `@` or `matmul`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
B = diag([-1, 0, -5])    # create a diagonal 3x3
print(B @ A)    # matrix product
```

$AB$ is undefined for these matrix sizes. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: raises-exception
print(A @ B)    # incompatible sizes
```

```{index} ! Python; elementwise multiplication, Python; broadcasting
```

The multiplication operator `*` is reserved for elementwise multiplication. Both operands have to be the same size, after any potential broadcasts.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: raises-exception
print(B * A)    # not the same size, so it's an error
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print((A / 2) * A)    # elementwise
```
To raise to a power elementwise, use a double star. This will broadcast as well.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(B)
print(B**3)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(x)
print(2.0**x)
```

```{danger}

```{index} Python; broadcasting

For a square matrix $A$, the command `solve(A, B)` is mathematically equivalent to $\mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{b}$.

```

```{code-cell} ipython3

One way to check the answer is to compute a quantity known as the **residual**. It is (ideally) close to machine precision(relative to the elements in the data). 

```{code-cell} ipython3
residual = b - A @ x
print(residual)
```

If the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is singular, you may get an error.

b = array([1, -1])

```

A linear system with a singular matrix might have no solution or infinitely many solutions, but in either case, a numerical solution becomes trickier. Detecting singularity is a lot like checking whether two floating-point numbers are *exactly* equal: because of roundoff, it could be missed. We're headed toward a more robust way to fully describe this situation.

It's easy to get just the lower triangular part of any matrix using the `tril` function.

```{code-cell} ipython3
A = 1 + floor(9 * random.rand(5, 5))
L = tril(A)
print(L)
```

We'll set up and solve a linear system with this matrix.

```{code-cell} ipython3
b = ones(5)
x = FNC.forwardsub(L, b)

```

It's not clear how accurate this answer is. However, the residual should be zero or comparable to $\macheps$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
b - L @ x
```

Next we'll engineer a problem to which we know the exact answer. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
alpha = 0.3;
beta = 2.2;
U = diag(ones(5)) + diag([-1, -1, -1, -1], k=1)
U[0, 3:5] = [ alpha - beta, beta ]

```{code-cell} ipython3
x_exact = ones(5)
b = array([alpha, 0, 0, 0, 1])
x = FNC.backsub(U, b)
print("error:", x - x_exact)
```

Everything seems OK here. But another example, with a different value for $\beta$, is more troubling.

```{code-cell} ipython3
alpha = 0.3;
beta = 1e12;
U = diag(ones(5)) + diag([-1, -1, -1, -1], k=1)
U[0, 3:5] = [ alpha - beta, beta ]
b = array([alpha, 0, 0, 0, 1])

x = FNC.backsub(U, b)
print("error:", x - x_exact)
```

It's not so good to get 4 digits of accuracy after starting with sixteen! But the source of the error is not hard to track down. Solving for $x_1$ performs $(\alpha-\beta)+\beta$ in the first row. Since $|\alpha|$ is so much smaller than $|\beta|$, this a recipe for losing digits to subtractive cancellation.

(demo-lu-derive-python)=

For illustration, we work on a $4 \times 4$ matrix. We name it with a subscript in preparation for what comes.

```{code-cell} ipython3
A_1 = array([
     [2,    0,    4,    3], 
     [-4,    5,   -7,  -10], 
     [1,   15,    2,   -4.5],
     [-2,    0,    2,  -13]
        ])
L = eye(4)
U = zeros((4, 4));
```

Now we appeal to {eq}`outer-row1`. Since $L_{11}=1$, we see that the first row of $\mathbf{U}$ is just the first row of $\mathbf{A}_1$.

```{code-cell}
U[0, :] = A_1[0, :]
print(U)
```

From {eq}`outer-col1`, we see that we can find the first column of $\mathbf{L}$ from the first column of $\mathbf{A}_1$. 

```{code-cell}
L[:, 0] = A_1[:, 0] / U[0, 0]
print(L)
```

We have obtained the first term in the sum {eq}`matrixouter` for $\mathbf{L}\mathbf{U}$, and we subtract it away from $\mathbf{A}_1$.

```{code-cell}
A_2 = A_1 - outer(L[:, 0],  U[0, :])
```

Now $\mathbf{A}_2 = \boldsymbol{\ell}_2\mathbf{u}_2^T + \boldsymbol{\ell}_3\mathbf{u}_3^T + \boldsymbol{\ell}_4\mathbf{u}_4^T.$ If we ignore the first row and first column of the matrices in this equation, then in what remains we are in the same situation as at the start. Specifically, only $\boldsymbol{\ell}_2\mathbf{u}_2^T$ has any effect on the second row and column, so we can deduce them now.

```{code-cell}
U[1, :] = A_2[1, :]
L[:, 1] = A_2[:, 1] / U[1, 1]
print(L)
```
If we subtract off the latest outer product, we have a matrix that is zero in the first *two* rows and columns. 

```{code-cell}
A_3 = A_2 - outer(L[:, 1], U[1, :])
```

Now we can deal with the lower right $2\times 2$ submatrix of the remainder in a similar fashion.

```{code-cell}
U[2, :] = A_3[2, :]
L[:, 2] = A_3[:, 2] / U[2, 2]
A_4 = A_3 - outer(L[:, 2], U[2, :])
```

Finally, we pick up the last unknown in the factors.

```{code-cell}
U[3, 3] = A_4[3, 3]
```

We now have all of $\mathbf{L}$,

```{code-cell} 
print(L)
```

and all of $\mathbf{U}$,

```{code-cell}
print(U)
```

We can verify that we have a correct factorization of the original matrix by computing the backward error:

```{code-cell} 
A_1 - L @ U
```

In floating point, we cannot expect the difference to be exactly zero as we found in this toy example. Instead, we would be satisfied to see that each element of the difference above is comparable in size to machine precision.

Here is a straightforward implementation of matrix-vector multiplication.

A = random.rand(n, n)
x = ones(n)
y = zeros(n)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        y[i] += A[i, j] * x[j]   # 2 flops
```

Each of the loops implies a summation of flops. The total flop count for this algorithm is

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n 2 = \sum_{i=1}^n 2n = 2n^2.
$$

Since the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ has $n^2$ elements, all of which have to be involved in the product, it seems unlikely that we could get a flop count that is smaller than $O(n^2)$ in general.

Let's run an experiment with the built-in matrix-vector multiplication. We assume that flops dominate the computation time and thus measure elapsed time. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
N = 400 * arange(1, 11)
t = []
print("  n           t")
for i, n in enumerate(N):

    for j in range(50): A @ x
    t.append(timer() - start)
    print(f"{n:5}   {t[-1]:10.3e}")
```

The reason for doing multiple repetitions at each value of $n$ above is to avoid having times so short that the resolution of the timer is a factor.

Looking at the timings just for $n=2000$ and $n=4000$, they have ratio:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(t[9] / t[4])
```

If the run time is dominated by flops, then we expect this ratio to be 

$$
\frac{2(4000)^2}{2(2000)^2}=4.

```{code-cell}
i = argmax( abs(A_1[:, 0]) )

This is the row of the matrix that we extract to put into $\mathbf{U}$. That guarantees that the division used to find $\boldsymbol{\ell}_1$ will be valid.

```{code-cell}
L, U = eye(4), zeros((4, 4))
U[0, :] = A_1[i, :]
L[:, 0] = A_1[:, 0] / U[0, 0]
A_2 = A_1 - outer(L[:, 0], U[0, :])
print(A_2)
```

Observe that $\mathbf{A}_2$ has a new zero row and zero column, but the zero row is the fourth rather than the first. However, we forge on by using the largest possible pivot in column 2 for the next outer product.

```{code-cell}
i = argmax( abs(A_2[:, 1]) ) 
print(f"new pivot row is {i}")
U[1, :] = A_2[i, :]
L[:, 1] = A_2[:, 1] / U[1, 1]
A_3 = A_2 - outer(L[:, 1], U[1, :])
print(A_3)
```
Now we have zeroed out the third row as well as the second column. We can finish out the procedure.

```{code-cell}
i = argmax( abs(A_3[:, 2]) ) 
print(f"new pivot row is {i}")
U[2, :] = A_3[i, :]
L[:, 2] = A_3[:, 2] / U[2, 2]
A_4 = A_3 - outer(L[:, 2], U[2, :])
print(A_4)
```

```{code-cell}
i = argmax( abs(A_4[:, 3]) ) 
print(f"new pivot row is {i}")
U[3, :] = A_4[i, :]
L[:, 3] = A_4[:, 3] / U[3, 3];
```

We do have a factorization of the original matrix:

```{code-cell}
A_1 - L @ U
```

And $\mathbf{U}$ has the required structure:

```{code-cell}
print(U)
```

However, the triangularity of $\mathbf{L}$ has been broken.

In `linalg.solve`, the matrix `A` is PLU-factored, followed by two triangular solves. If we want to do those steps seamlessly, we can use the `lu_factor` and `lu_solve` from `scipy.linalg`.

Why would we ever bother with this? In {numref}`section-linsys-efficiency` we showed that the factorization is by far the most costly part of the solution process. A factorization object allows us to do that costly step only once per matrix, but solve with multiple right-hand sides.

We can factor the matrix without pivoting and solve for $\mathbf{x}$.

Note that we have obtained only about 5 accurate digits for $x_1$. We could make the result even more inaccurate by making $\epsilon$ even smaller:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from numpy.linalg import norm
A = array([ [2, 0], [1, -1] ])
```

```{index} ! Python; norm
```

The default matrix norm is *not* the 2-norm. Instead, you must provide the 2 explicitly. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(norm(A, 2))
```

You can get the 1-norm as well.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(norm(A, 1))
```

```{index} ! Python; max, Python; sum
```

The 1-norm is equivalent to 

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(max( sum(abs(A), axis=0)) )  # sum down the rows
```

Similarly, we can get the $\infty$-norm and check our formula for it.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(norm(A, inf))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(max( sum(abs(A), axis=1)) )  # sum across columns 
```

Here we illustrate the geometric interpretation of the 2-norm. First, we will sample a lot of vectors on the unit circle in $\mathbb{R}^2$. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
theta = linspace(0, 2*pi, 601)
x = vstack([cos(theta), sin(theta)])  # 601 unit columns
```

The linear function $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$ defines a mapping from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$. We can apply `A` to every column of `x` simply by using a matrix multiplication.

```{code-cell} ipython3
y = A @ x
```

We plot the unit circle on the left and the image of all mapped vectors on the right: 

```{code-cell} ipython3
subplot(1,2,1)
plot(x[0, :], x[1, :])
axis("equal")
title("Unit circle")
xlabel("$x_1$")
ylabel("$x_2$")

subplot(1,2,2)
plot(y[0, :], y[1, :])
plot(norm(A, 2) * x[0, :], norm(A,2) * x[1, :],"--")
axis("equal")
title("Image under map")
xlabel("$y_1$")
ylabel("$y_2$");
```

As seen on the right-side plot, the image of the transformed vectors is an ellipse that just touches the circle of radius $\|\mathbf{A}\|_2$.

(demo-condition-bound-python)=
``````{dropdown} Matrix condition number

```{index} ! Python; cond
```

The function `cond` from `numpy.linalg` is used to computes matrix condition numbers. By default, the 2-norm is used. As an example, the family of *Hilbert matrices* is famously badly conditioned. Here is the $6\times 6$  case. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
A = array([ 
    [1/(i + j + 2) for j in range(6)] 
    for i in range(6) 
    ])
print(A)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
from numpy.linalg import cond
kappa = cond(A)
print(f"kappa is {kappa:.3e}")
```

Next we engineer a linear system problem to which we know the exact answer.

```{code-cell} ipython3
x_exact = 1.0 + arange(6)
b = A @ x_exact
```

Now we perturb the data randomly with a vector of norm $10^{-12}$. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
dA = random.randn(6, 6)
dA = 1e-12 * (dA / norm(dA, 2))
db = random.randn(6)
db = 1e-12 * (db / norm(db, 2))
```

We solve the perturbed problem using built-in pivoted LU and see how the solution was changed.

```{code-cell} ipython3
x = solve(A + dA, b + db) 
dx = x - x_exact
```

Here is the relative error in the solution.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(f"relative error is {norm(dx) / norm(x_exact):.2e}")
```

And here are upper bounds predicted using the condition number of the original matrix. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(f"b_bound: {kappa * 1e-12 / norm(b):.2e}")
print(f"A_bound: {kappa * 1e-12 / norm(A, 2):.2e}")
```

Even if we don't make any manual perturbations to the data, machine epsilon does when we solve the linear system numerically.

```{code-cell} ipython3
x = solve(A, b)
print(f"relative error: {norm(x - x_exact) / norm(x_exact):.2e}")
print(f"rounding bound: {kappa / 2**52:.2e}")

```

Because $\kappa\approx 10^8$, it's possible to lose 8 digits of accuracy in the process of passing from $A$ and $b$ to $x$. That's independent of the algorithm; it's inevitable once the data are expressed in double precision. 

Larger Hilbert matrices are even more poorly conditioned.

```{code-cell} ipython3
A = array([ [1/(i+j+2) for j in range(14)] for i in range(14) ])
kappa = cond(A)
print(f"kappa is {kappa:.3e}")
```

Before we compute the solution, note that $\kappa$ exceeds `1/eps`. In principle we therefore might end up with an answer that is completely wrong (i.e., a relative error greater than 100%).

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(f"rounding bound: {kappa / 2**52:.2e}")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
x_exact = 1.0 + arange(14)
b = A @ x_exact  
x = solve(A, b)
```

We got an answer. But in fact, the error does exceed 100%:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(f"relative error: {norm(x - x_exact) / norm(x_exact):.2e}")
```

We won't use pivoting, so the pivot element is at position (1,1). This will become the first element on the diagonal of $\mathbf{D}$. Then we divide by that pivot to get the first column of $\mathbf{L}$.
