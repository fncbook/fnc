# Eigenvalue decomposition

To this point we have dealt frequently with the solution of the linear system $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$. Alongside this problem in its importance to linear algebra is the eigenvalue problem.

```{index} ! eigenvalue, ! eigenvector
```

(definition-evd-eigenvalue)=
::::{prf:definition} Eigenvalue and eigenvector
Given a square matrix $\mathbf{A}$, if 

```{math}
:label: eigdef
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \lambda \mathbf{x}
```

for a scalar $\lambda$ and a nonzero vector $\mathbf{x}$, then $\lambda$ is an **eigenvalue** and $\mathbf{x}$ is an associated **eigenvector**.

## Complex matrices

A matrix with real entries can have complex eigenvalues. Therefore we assume all matrices, vectors, and scalars may be complex in what follows. Recall that a complex number can be represented as $a+i b$ for real $a$ and $b$ and where $i^2=-1$. The **complex conjugate** of $x=a+i b$ is denoted $\bar{x}$ and is given by $\bar{x}=a-i b$. The **magnitude** or *modulus* of a complex number $z$ is 

$$
|z| = \sqrt{z\cdot \bar{z}}.
$$

```{index} ! unitary matrix, orthogonal matrix
```

::::{prf:definition} Terms for complex matrices
The **adjoint** or *hermitian* of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is denoted $\mathbf{A}^*$ and is given by $\mathbf{A}^*=(\overline{\mathbf{A}})^T=\overline{\mathbf{A}^T}$. The matrix is **self-adjoint** or **hermitian** if $\mathbf{A}^*=\mathbf{A}$.

The **2-norm** of a complex vector $\mathbf{u}$ is $\sqrt{\mathbf{u}^*\mathbf{u}}$. Other vector norms, and all matrix norms, are as defined in {numref}`section-linsys-norms`.

Complex vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ of the same dimension are **orthogonal** if $\mathbf{u}^*\mathbf{v}=0$. **Orthonormal** vectors are mutually orthogonal and have unit 2-norm. A **unitary** matrix is a square matrix with orthonormal columns, or, equivalently, a matrix satisfying $\mathbf{A}^* = \mathbf{A}^{-1}$.
::::

For the most part, "adjoint" replaces "transpose," "hermitian" replaces "symmetric," and "unitary matrix" replaces "orthogonal matrix" when applying our previous results to complex matrices. 

## Eigenvalue decomposition

```{index} ! characteristic polynomial
```

An easy rewrite of the eigenvalue definition {eq}`eigdef` is that $(\mathbf{A} - \lambda\mathbf{I}) \mathbf{x} = \boldsymbol{0}$. Hence $(\mathbf{A} - \lambda\mathbf{I})$ is singular, and it therefore must have a zero determinant. This is the property most often used to compute eigenvalues by hand.

::::{prf:example}
Given 

```{math}
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 4 & 1 \end{bmatrix},
```

we compute

```{math}
\begin{vmatrix}
1-\lambda & 1\\ 
4 & 1-\lambda
\end{vmatrix}
= (1-\lambda)^2 - 4 = \lambda^2-2\lambda-3.
```

The eigenvalues are the roots of this quadratic, $\lambda_1=3$ and $\lambda_2=-1$. 
::::

The determinant $\det(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I})$ is called the **characteristic polynomial**. Its roots are the eigenvalues, so we know that an $n\times n$ matrix has $n$ eigenvalues, counting algebraic multiplicity. 

Suppose that $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}_k=\lambda_k\mathbf{v}_k$ for $k=1,\ldots,n$. We can summarize these as

```{math}
\begin{split}
   \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}_1 & \mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}_2 & \cdots & \mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}_n
  \end{bmatrix}
  &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \lambda_1 \mathbf{v}_1 & \lambda_2\mathbf{v}_2 & \cdots & \lambda_n \mathbf{v}_n
    \end{bmatrix}, \\[1mm]
  \mathbf{A} \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{v}_1 & \mathbf{v}_2 & \cdots & \mathbf{v}_n
  \end{bmatrix}
  &=
\begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{v}_1 & \mathbf{v}_2 & \cdots & \mathbf{v}_n
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \lambda_1 & &  &  \\
    & \lambda_2 & & \\
    & & \ddots & \\
    & & & \lambda_n
  \end{bmatrix},
\end{split}
```

which we write as

```{math}
:label: ev-all
  \mathbf{A} \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{V} \mathbf{D}.
```

If we find that $\mathbf{V}$ is a nonsingular matrix, then we arrive at a key factorization.[^factdecomp]

[^factdecomp]: The terms "factorization" and "decomposition" are equivalent; they coexist mainly for historical reasons.

```{index} ! matrix factorization; EVD, diagonal matrix
```

```{index} ! eigenvalue decomposition, ! diagonalizable matrix
```

::::{prf:definition} Eigenvalue decomposition (EVD)
An **eigenvalue decomposition** (EVD) of a square matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is

```{math}
:label: evdecomp
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{V} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{V}^{-1}.
```

If $\mathbf{A}$ has an EVD, we say that $\mathbf{A}$ is **diagonalizable**; otherwise $\mathbf{A}$ is **nondiagonalizable** (or *defective*).
::::

Observe that if $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}$ for nonzero $\mathbf{v}$, then the equation remains true for any nonzero multiple of $\mathbf{v}$. Therefore, eigenvectors are not unique, and thus neither is an EVD.

We stress that while {eq}`ev-all` is possible for all square matrices, {eq}`evdecomp` is not.  One simple example of a nondiagonalizable matrix is

```{math}
:label: jordanblock
  \mathbf{B} = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 1\\0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}.
```

There is a common circumstance in which we can guarantee an EVD exists. The proof of the following theorem can be found in many elementary texts on linear algebra.

````{prf:theorem}
If the $n\times n$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ has $n$ distinct eigenvalues, then $\mathbf{A}$ is diagonalizable.

## Similarity and matrix powers

```{index} ! similarity transformation
```

The particular relationship between matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ in {eq}`evdecomp` is important. 

:::{prf:definition} Similar matrices
If $\mathbf{S}$ is any nonsingular matrix, we say that $\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{S}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{S}^{-1}$ is a **similarity transformation** of $\mathbf{A}$, and we say that $\mathbf{B}$ is **similar** to $\mathbf{A}$.
:::

 A similarity transformation does not change eigenvalues, a fact that is typically proved in elementary linear algebra texts.

````{prf:theorem}
If $\mathbf{S}$ is a nonsingular matrix, then $\mathbf{S}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{S}^{-1}$ has the same eigenvalues as $\mathbf{A}$.
````

<!-- 
Similarity transformation has an interesting interpretation. First, consider the product of a nonsingular $\mathbf{X}$ with any vector:

```{math}
  \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{z} = z_1 \mathbf{x}_1 +  \dots + z_n \mathbf{x}_n.
```

We call $z_1,\ldots,z_n$ the *coordinates* of the vector $\mathbf{y}$ with respect to the columns of $\mathbf{X}$. That is, $\mathbf{z}$ is a representation of $\mathbf{y}$ in the basis implied by the columns of $\mathbf{X}$. But also $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{X}^{-1} \mathbf{y}$. Hence left-multiplication by $\mathbf{X}^{-1}$ converts the vector $\mathbf{y}$ into those coordinates. 

:::{prf:observation} Change of basis
Multiplication by the inverse of a matrix performs a *change of basis* into the coordinates associated with the columns of that matrix.
:::

In the product $\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}$, think of $\mathbf{x}$ as the input and $\mathbf{u}$ as the output of the linear transformation defined by multiplication by $\mathbf{A}$. Now the EVD {eq}`evdecomp` implies

$$
(\mathbf{V}^{-1}\mathbf{u}) = \mathbf{D}(\mathbf{V}^{-1}\mathbf{x}).
$$

This equation says that if you express the input $\mathbf{x}$ and the output $\mathbf{u}$ into the coordinates of the $\mathbf{V}$-basis, then the relationship between them is diagonal. That is, the EVD is about finding a basis for $\mathbb{C}^n$ in which the map $\mathbf{x}\mapsto\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$ is a diagonal one. Diagonal transformations are those in which the coordinates are independently rescaled. 
-->

The EVD is especially useful for matrix powers. To begin,

```{math}
\mathbf{A}^2=(\mathbf{V}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{V}^{-1})(\mathbf{V}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{V}^{-1})=\mathbf{V}\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{V}^{-1}\mathbf{V})\mathbf{D}\mathbf{V}^{-1}=\mathbf{V}\mathbf{D}^2\mathbf{V}^{-1}.
```

Multiplying this result by $\mathbf{A}$ repeatedly, we find that 

```{math}
:label: evdpower
\mathbf{A}^k = \mathbf{V}\mathbf{D}^k\mathbf{V}^{-1}.
```

Because $\mathbf{D}$ is diagonal, its power $\mathbf{D}^k$ is just the diagonal matrix of the $k$th powers of the eigenvalues.

Furthermore, given a polynomial $p(z)=c_0+c_1 z + \cdots + c_m z^m$, we can apply the polynomial to the matrix in a straightforward way,

```{math}
:label: matrixpoly
p(\mathbf{A}) = c_0\mathbf{I}  +c_1 \mathbf{A} + \cdots + c_m \mathbf{A}^m.
```

Applying {eq}`evdpower` leads to 

```{math}
:label: matrixpolyevd
\begin{split}
p(\mathbf{A}) & = c_0\mathbf{V}\mathbf{V}^{-1}  +c_1 \mathbf{V}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{V}^{-1} + \cdots + c_m \mathbf{V}\mathbf{D}^m\mathbf{V}^{-1} \\ 
&= \mathbf{V} \cdot [ c_0\mathbf{I}  +c_1 \mathbf{D} + \cdots + c_m \mathbf{D}^m] \cdot \mathbf{V}^{-1} \\[1mm] 
&= \mathbf{V} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
  p(\lambda_1) & & & \\ & p(\lambda_2) & &  \\ & & \ddots & \\ & & & p(\lambda_n)  
\end{bmatrix} \cdot \mathbf{V}^{-1}.
\end{split}
```

Finally, given the convergence of Taylor polynomials to common functions, we are able to apply a function $f$ to a square matrix by replacing $p$ with $f$ in {eq}`matrixpoly`.

## Conditioning of eigenvalues


```{index} ! eigenvalue; conditioning of, condition number; of eigenvalues
```

```{index} ! Bauer–Fike theorem
```

Just as linear systems have condition numbers that quantify the effect of finite precision, eigenvalue problems may be poorly conditioned too. While many possible results can be derived, we will use just one, the **Bauer–Fike theorem**.

(theorem-bauer-fike)=
````{prf:theorem} Bauer–Fike
Let $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$ be diagonalizable, $\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{V}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{V}^{-1}$, with eigenvalues $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n$. If $\mu$ is an eigenvalue of $\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{E}$ for a complex matrix $\mathbf{E}$, then

```{math}
:label: bauerfike
\min_{j=1,\ldots,n} |\mu - \lambda_j| \le \kappa(\mathbf{V}) \, \| \mathbf{E} \|\,,
```

where $\|\cdot\|$ and $\kappa$ are in the 2-norm.
````

The Bauer–Fike theorem tells us that eigenvalues can be perturbed by an amount that is $\kappa(\mathbf{V})$ times larger than perturbations to the matrix. This result is a bit less straightforward than it might seem—eigenvectors are not unique, so there are multiple possible values for $\kappa(\mathbf{V})$. Even so, the theorem indicates caution when a matrix has eigenvectors that form an ill-conditioned matrix. The limiting case of $\kappa(\mathbf{V})=\infty$ might be interpreted as indicating a nondiagonalizable matrix $\mathbf{A}$. The other extreme is also of interest: $\kappa(\mathbf{V})=1$, which implies that $\mathbf{V}$ is unitary.

```{index} ! normal matrix, unitary matrix
```

::::{prf:definition} Normal matrix
If $\mathbf{A}$ has an EVD {eq}`evdecomp` with a unitary eigenvector matrix $\mathbf{V}$, then $\mathbf{A}$ is a **normal matrix**. 
::::

As we will see in {numref}`section-matrixanaly-symm-eig`, hermitian and real symmetric matrices are normal. Since the condition number of a unitary matrix is equal to 1, {eq}`bauerfike` guarantees that a perturbation of a normal matrix changes the eigenvalues by the same amount or less.

## Computing the EVD

Roots of the characteristic polynomial are not used in numerical methods for finding eigenvalues.[^eigpoly] Practical algorithms for computing the EVD go beyond the scope of this book. The essence of the matter is the connection to matrix powers indicated in {eq}`evdpower`. (We will see much more about the importance of matrix powers in Chapter 8.) 

If the eigenvalues have different complex magnitudes, then as $k\to\infty$ the entries on the diagonal of $\mathbf{D}^k$ become increasingly well separated and easy to pick out. It turns out that there is an astonishingly easy and elegant way to accomplish this separation without explicitly computing the matrix powers.

[^eigpoly]: In fact, the situation is reversed: eigenvalue methods are among the best ways to compute the roots of a given polynomial.

The process demonstrated in {numref}`Demo {number} <demo-evd-francisqr>` is known as the *Francis QR iteration*, and it can be formulated as an $O(n^3)$ algorithm for finding the EVD. Such an algorithm is the foundation of what the `eigen` function uses.
