This is a new edition of the textbook [Fundamentals of Numerical Computation](https://tobydriscoll.net/FNC) by Tobin A. Driscoll and Richard J. Braun. Bound print books are available for purchase in [MATLAB](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611975086) and [Julia](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611977011) editions at the SIAM Bookstore. That material is copyright © Society of Applied and Industrial Mathematics. 

```{warning}
There are some changes from the print editions. Exercise numbers may not align, for example.

All the content is generated by the code that you see on the pages (after a few setup steps that are explained in the links above). If you see it done here, you should be able to make it work for yourself.
