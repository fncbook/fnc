The check `t[i]+h == t[i]`on line 19 is to detect when $h$ has become so small that it no longer changes the floating-point value of $t_i$. This may be a sign that the underlying exact solution has a singularity near $t=t_i$, but in any case, the solver must halt by using a `break` statement to exit the loop.

On line 30, we use a combination of absolute and relative tolerances to judge the acceptability of a solution value, as in {eq}`absreltolerance`. In lines 41--43 we underestimate the step factor $q$ a bit and prevent a huge increase in the step size, since a rejected step is expensive, and then we make sure that our final step doesn't take us past the end of the domain.

Finally, line 37 exploits a subtle property of the BS23 formula called *first same as last* (FSAL).
While {eq}`bs23` calls for four stages to find the paired second- and third-order estimates, the final stage computed in stepping from $t_i$ to $t_{i+1}$ is identical to the first stage needed to step from $t_{i+1}$ to $t_{i+2}$. By repurposing `s₄` as `s₁` for the next pass, one of the stage evaluations comes for free, and only three evaluations of $f$ are needed per successful step.

Then line 24 computes the vector $[f_2,f_1,f_0]$.

Line 28 computes $f_i$, based on the most recent solution value and time. That goes into the first spot of `f`, followed by the three values that were previously most recent.

### 6.1 @section-ivp-basics
(demo-basics-first-julia)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-basics-first
:open:
The `OrdinaryDiffEq` package offers solvers for IVPs. Let's use it to define and solve the initial-value problem 

```{math}
:numbered: false
u'=\sin[(u+t)^2], \quad t \in [0,4], \quad u(0)=-1.
```

To create an initial-value problem for $u(t)$, we must supply a function that computes $u'$, an initial value for $u$, and the endpoints of the interval for $t$. The $t$ interval should be defined as `(a, b)`, where at least one of the values is a float.

```{tip}
Because many practical problems come with parameters that are fixed within an instance but varied from one instance to another, the syntax for IVPs includes a input argument `p` that stays fixed throughout the solution. Here we don't want to use that argument, but it must be in the definition for the solver to work.
```

```{index} ! Julia; ODEProblem, ! Julia; solve
```

```{code-cell}
f(u, p, t) = sin((t + u)^2)     # defines du/dt, must include p argument
u₀ = -1.0                       # initial value
tspan = (0.0, 4.0)               # t interval
```

With the data above we define an IVP problem object and then solve it. Here we tell the solver to use the `Tsit5` method, which is a good first choice for most problems.

```{code-cell}
using OrdinaryDiffEq
ivp = ODEProblem(f, u₀, tspan)
sol = solve(ivp, Tsit5());
```

The resulting solution object can be shown using `plot`.

```{code-cell}
using Plots
plot(sol;
    label="solution", legend=:bottom,
    xlabel="t",  ylabel=L"u(t)",
    title=L"u'=\sin((t+u)^2)")
```

The solution also acts like any callable function that can be evaluated at different values of $t$.

```{code-cell}
@show sol(1.0);
```

Under the hood, the solution object holds some information about how the values and plot are produced:

```{code-cell}
[sol.t sol.u]
```

The solver initially finds approximate values of the solution (second column above) at some automatically chosen times (first column above). To compute the solution at other times, the object performs an interpolation on those values. This chapter is about how the discrete $t$ and $u$ values are computed. For now, just note how we can extract them from the solution object.

```{code-cell}
scatter!(sol.t, sol.u, label="discrete values")
```
``````

(demo-basics-sing-julia)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-basics-sing
:open:

The equation $u'=(u+t)^2$ gives us some trouble.

```{code-cell}
f(u, p, t) = (t + u)^2
ivp = ODEProblem(f, 1.0, (0.0, 1.0))
sol = solve(ivp, Tsit5());
```

The warning message we received can mean that there is a bug in the formulation of the problem. But if everything has been done correctly, it suggests that the solution may not exist past the indicated time. This is a possibility in nonlinear ODEs.

```{code-cell}
plot(sol, label="";
    xlabel=L"t",  yaxis=(:log10, L"u(t)"),
    title="Finite-time blowup")
```
``````

(demo-basics-cond-julia)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-basics-cond
:open:
Consider the ODEs $u'=u$ and $u'=-u$. In each case we compute $\partial f/\partial u = \pm 1$, so the condition number bound from @theorem-depIC is $e^{b-a}$ in both problems. However, they behave quite differently. In the case of exponential growth, $u'=u$, the bound is the actual condition number.

```{code-cell}
:tags: remove-input
t = range(0, 3, length=800)
u = @. exp(t) * 1
lower, upper = @. exp(t) * 0.7, @. exp(t) * 1.3
plot(t, u;
    l=:black, ribbon=(lower, upper),
    leg=:none,  xlabel=L"t",  ylabel=L"u(t)",
    title="Exponential divergence of solutions")
```

But with $u'=-u$, solutions actually get closer together with time.

```{code-cell}
:tags: remove-input
u = @. exp(-t) * 1
lower, upper = @. exp(-t) * 0.7, @. exp(-t) * 1.3
plot(t, u;
    l=:black,  ribbon=(lower, upper),
    leg=:none,  xlabel=L"t",  ylabel=L"u(t)",
    title="Exponential convergence of solutions")
```

In this case the actual condition number is one, because the initial difference between solutions is the largest over all time. Hence the exponentially growing bound $e^{b-a}$ is a gross overestimate.
``````

### 6.2 @section-ivp-euler

(demo-euler-converge-julia)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-euler-converge
:open:
We consider the IVP

```{math}
:numbered: false
u'=\sin[(u+t)^2], \quad t \in [0,4], \quad u(0)=-1.
```

```{code-cell}
using OrdinaryDiffEq
f(u, p, t) = sin((t + u)^2);
tspan = (0.0, 4.0);
u0 = -1.0;
ivp = ODEProblem(f, u0, tspan)
```

Here is the call to {numref}`Function {number} <function-euler>`.

```{code-cell}
using Plots
t, u = FNC.euler(ivp, 20)
plot(t, u;
    m=2,  label="n=20", 
    xlabel=L"t",  ylabel=L"u(t)",
    title="Solution by Euler's method")
```

We could define a different interpolant to get a smoother picture above, but the derivation of Euler's method assumed a piecewise linear interpolant, and that sets the limit of its accuracy. We can instead request more steps to make the interpolant look smoother.

```{code-cell}
t, u = FNC.euler(ivp, 50)
plot!(t, u, m=2, label="n=50")
```

Increasing $n$ changed the solution noticeably. Since we know that interpolants and finite differences become more accurate as $h\to 0$, we should anticipate the same behavior from Euler's method. We don't have an exact solution to compare to, so we will use a `DifferentialEquations` solver to construct an accurate reference solution.

```{code-cell}
u_exact = solve(ivp, Tsit5(), reltol=1e-14, abstol=1e-14)
plot!(u_exact, l=(2, :black), label="reference")
```

Now we can perform a convergence study.

```{code-cell}
n = [round(Int, 5 * 10^k) for k in 0:0.5:3]
err = []
for n in n
    t, u = FNC.euler(ivp, n)
    push!(err, norm(u_exact.(t) - u, Inf))
end
@pt :header=["n", "inf-norm error"] [n err]
```

The error is approximately cut by a factor of 10 for each increase in $n$ by the same factor. A log-log plot also confirms first-order convergence. Keep in mind that since $h=(b-a)/n$, it follows that $O(h)=O(n^{-1})$.

```{code-cell}
plot(n, err;
    m=:o, label="results",
    xaxis=(:log10, L"n"),  yaxis=(:log10, "inf-norm global error"),
    title="Convergence of Euler's method")

# Add line for perfect 1st order.
plot!(n, 0.5 * err[end] * (n / n[end]) .^ (-1), l=:dash, label=L"O(n^{-1})")
```
``````

### 6.3 @section-ivp-systems

(demo-systems-predator-julia)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-systems-predator
:open:
We encode the predator–prey equations via a function.

```{code-cell}
function predprey(u, p, t)
    α, β = p      # rename parameters for convenience
    y, z = u      # rename solution components
    s = (y * z) / (1 + β * y)     # appears in both equations
    return [y * (1 - α * y) - s, -z + s]
end;
```

As before, the ODE function must accept three inputs, `u`, `p`, and `t`, even though in this case there is no explicit dependence on `t`. The second input is used to pass parameters that don't change throughout a single instance of the problem.

To specify the IVP, we must also provide the initial condition, which is a 2-vector here, and the interval for the independent variable.

```{code-cell}
using OrdinaryDiffEq
u₀ = [1, 0.01]
tspan = (0.0, 60.0)
α, β = 0.1, 0.25
ivp = ODEProblem(predprey, u₀, tspan, [α, β])
```

You can use any `DifferentialEquations` solver on the IVP system.

```{code-cell}
using Plots
sol = solve(ivp, Tsit5());
plot(sol, label=["prey" "predator"],
    title="Predator-prey solution")
```

We can find the discrete values used to compute the interpolated solution. The `sol.u` value is a vector of vectors.

```{code-cell}
t, u = sol.t, sol.u    # extract times and solution values
@show size(u);
@show t[20];
@show u[20];
```

We can also use {numref}`Function {number} <function-euler>` to find the solution.

```{code-cell}
t, u = FNC.euler(ivp, 1200);
```

The solution `u` is a vector of [prey,predator] 2-vectors for each of the discrete times in `t`. Manipulating the vector-of-vectors output can be a little tricky. Here, we convert it to an $n\times 2$ matrix. Each column is one component, while each row is a single value of $t$.

```{code-cell}
u = [u[j] for u in u, j in 1:2]
plot!(t[1:3:end], u[1:3:end, :];
    l=(1, :black),  m=2,
    label=["Euler prey" "Euler predator"])
```

Notice above that the accuracy of the Euler solution deteriorates rapidly.

When there are just two components, it's common to plot the solution in the _phase plane_, i.e., with $u_1$ and $u_2$ along the axes and time as a parameterization of the curve.

```{tip}
:class: dropdown
You can use `idxs` in the plot of a solution produced by `solve` to specify the components of the solution that appear on each axis.
```

```{code-cell}
plot(sol, idxs=(1, 2),
    title="Predator-prey solution in the phase plane",
    xlabel=L"y(t)",  ylabel=L"z(t)")
```

As time progresses, the point in the phase plane spirals inward toward a limiting closed loop called a *limit cycle* representing a periodic solution:


```{index} Julia; @animate
```

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-input, remove-output]
prey, predator = [], []
anim = @animate for t in range(0, 60, 801)
    y, z = sol(t)
    plot(prey, predator;
        title="Predator-prey solution in the phase plane",
        xlabel=L"y(t)",  ylabel=L"z(t)", legend=false)
    push!(prey, y)
    push!(predator, z)
    scatter!([y], [z], m=(5, :red))
    xlims!(0, 9)
    ylims!(0, 6)
end
mp4(anim, "figures/predator-prey.mp4")
```

(demo-systems-coupledpendula-julia)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-systems-coupledpendula
:open:
Let's implement the coupled pendulums from @example-systems-coupledpendula. The pendulums will be pulled in opposite directions and then released together from rest.

```{tip}
:class: dropdown
The `similar` function creates an array of the same size and type as a given value, without initializing the contents.
```

```{code-cell}
function couple(u, p, t)
    γ, L, k = p
    g = 9.8
    udot = similar(u)
    udot[1:2] .= u[3:4]
    udot[3] = -γ * u[3] - (g / L) * sin(u[1]) + k * (u[2] - u[1])
    udot[4] = -γ * u[4] - (g / L) * sin(u[2]) + k * (u[1] - u[2])
    return udot
end

u₀ = [1.25, -0.3, 0, 0]
tspan = (0.0, 50.0);
```

First we check the behavior of the system when the pendulums are uncoupled, i.e., when $k=0$.

```{tip}
:class: dropdown
Here `idxs` is used to plot two components as functions of time.
```

```{code-cell}
γ, L, k = 0, 0.5, 0
ivp = ODEProblem(couple, u₀, tspan, [γ, L, k])
sol = solve(ivp, Tsit5())
plot(sol, idxs=[1, 2], 
    label=[L"\theta_1" L"\theta_2"],
    xlims=[20, 50], 
    title="Uncoupled pendulums")
```

You can see that the pendulums swing independently:

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-input, remove-output]
anim = @animate for t in range(0, 24, 251)
    θ₁, θ₂, _ = sol(t)
    plot([0, sin(θ₁)], [0, -cos(θ₁)], l=4;
        layout=(1, 2), aspect_ratio=1, grid=false,
        xaxis=((-1.1, 1.1), false), yaxis=((-1.1, 0.1), false), legend=false)
    plot!([0, sin(θ₂)], [0, -cos(θ₂)], l=4;

        xaxis=((-1.1, 1.1), false), yaxis=((-1.1, 0.1), false), legend=false)
    scatter!([sin(θ₁)], [-cos(θ₁)], m=(5, :black), subplot=1)
    scatter!([sin(θ₂)], [-cos(θ₂)], m=(5, :black), subplot=2)

end
mp4(anim, "figures/pendulums-weak.mp4")
```

![Uncoupled pendulums](figures/pendulums-weak.mp4)

Because the model is nonlinear and the initial angles are not small, they have slightly different periods of oscillation, and they go in and out of phase.

With coupling activated, a different behavior is seen.

```{code-cell}
k = 1
ivp = ODEProblem(couple, u₀, tspan, [γ, L, k])
sol = solve(ivp, Tsit5())
plot(sol, idxs=[1, 2], 
    label=[L"\theta_1" L"\theta_2"],
    xlims=[20, 50], 
    title="Coupled pendulums")
```

The coupling makes the pendulums swap energy back and forth:

```{code-cell}

    θ₁, θ₂, _ = sol(t)

The method should converge as $O(h^4)$, so a log-log scale is appropriate for the errors.

```{code-cell}
using Plots
plot(n, err, m=3, 
    label="AB4",  legend=:bottomleft,
    xaxis=(:log10, L"n"),  yaxis=(:log10, "inf-norm error"),
    title="Convergence of AB4")

plot!(n, 0.1 * err[end] * (n / n[end]) .^ (-4), l=:dash, label=L"O(n^{-4})")
```

The following simple ODE uncovers a surprise.

```{code-cell}
ivp = ODEProblem((u, p, t) -> u^2 - u^3, 0.005, (0, 400.0))
```

We will solve the problem first with the implicit AM2 method using $n=200$ steps.

```{code-cell}
tI, uI = FNC.am2(ivp, 200)

plot(tI, uI;
    label="AM2", legend=:bottomright,
    xlabel=L"t",  ylabel=L"u(t)")
```

Now we repeat the process using the explicit AB4 method.

```{code-cell}
tE, uE = FNC.ab4(ivp, 200)
scatter!(tE, uE, m=3, label="AB4", ylim=[-4, 2])
```

Once the solution starts to take off, the AB4 result goes catastrophically wrong.

```{code-cell}
uE[105:111]
```

We hope that AB4 will converge in the limit $h\to 0$, so let's try using more steps.

```{code-cell}
plt = scatter(tI, uI;
    m=3,  label="AM2, n=200",  legend=:bottomright,
    xlabel=L"t",  ylabel=L"u(t)")

for n in [1000, 1600]
    tE, uE = FNC.ab4(ivp, n)
    plot!(tE, uE, label="AM4, n=$n")
end
plt
```

So AB4, which is supposed to be _more_ accurate than AM2, actually needs something like 8 times as many steps to get a reasonable-looking answer!

We'll measure the error at the time $t=1$.

```{code-cell}
du_dt(u, t) = u
û = exp
a, b = 0.0, 1.0;
n = [5, 10, 20, 40, 60]
err = []
t, u = [], []
for n in n
    h = (b - a) / n
    t = [a + i * h for i in 0:n]
    u = [1; û(h); zeros(n - 1)]
    f_val = [du_dt(u[1], t[1]); zeros(n)]
    for i in 2:n
        f_val[i] = du_dt(u[i], t[i])
        u[i+1] = -4 * u[i] + 5 * u[i-1] + h * (4 * f_val[i] + 2 * f_val[i-1])
    end
    push!(err, abs(û(b) - u[end]))
end
@pt :header=["n", "h", "error"] [n (b - a) ./ n err]
```

The error starts out promisingly, but things explode from there. A graph of the last numerical attempt yields a clue.

```{code-cell}
using Plots
plot(t, abs.(u);
    m=3,  label="",
    xlabel=L"t",  yaxis=(:log10, L"|u(t)|"), 
    title="LIAF solution")
```

It's clear that the solution is growing exponentially in time.
