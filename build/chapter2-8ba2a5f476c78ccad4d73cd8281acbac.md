We create two vectors for data about the population of China. The first has the years of census data and the other has the population, in millions of people.

```{code-cell}
year = [1982, 2000, 2010, 2015]; 
pop = [1008.18, 1262.64, 1337.82, 1374.62];

It's convenient to measure time in years since 1980. We use `.-` to subtract a scalar from every element of a vector. We will also use a floating-point value in the subtraction, so the result is also in double precision.

A dotted operator such as `.-` or `.*` acts elementwise, broadcasting scalar values to match up with elements of an array.

Now we have four data points $(t_1,y_1),\dots,(t_4,y_4)$, so $n=4$ and we seek an interpolating cubic polynomial. We construct the associated Vandermonde matrix:
:::{card}
An expression inside square brackets and ending with a `for` statement is called a **comprehension**. It's often an easy and readable way to construct vectors and matrices.

To solve for the vector of polynomial coefficients, we use a backslash to solve the linear system:
:::{card}
A **backslash** `\` is used to solve a linear system of equations.
:::
::::

```{code-cell}
c = V \ y
```

The algorithms used by the backslash operator are the main topic of this chapter. As a check on the solution, we can compute the *residual*.

```{code-cell} julia
y - V*c
```

Using floating-point arithmetic, it is not realistic to expect exact equality of quantities; a relative difference comparable to $\macheps$ is all we can look for.

::::{grid} 1 1 2 2
By our definitions, the elements of `c` are coefficients in ascending-degree order for the interpolating polynomial. We can use the polynomial to estimate the population of China in 2005:
:::{card}
The `Polynomials` package has functions to make working with polynomials easy and efficient.
:::
::::

```{code-cell}
p = Polynomial(c)    # construct a polynomial
p(2005-1980)         # include the 1980 time shift
```

The official population value for 2005 was 1303.72, so our result is rather good. 

:::{index} ! Julia; scatter

We can visualize the interpolation process. First, we plot the data as points.

The `scatter` function creates a scatter plot of points; you can specify a line connecting the points as well.

We want to superimpose a plot of the polynomial. We do that by evaluating it at a vector of points in the interval. The dot after the name of the polynomial is a universal way to apply a function to every element of an array, a technique known as **broadcasting**.
:::{card}
The `range` function constructs evenly spaced values given the endpoints and either the number of values, or the step size between them.

Adding a dot to the end of a function name causes it to be broadcast, i.e., applied to every element of a vector or matrix.
:::
::::

```{code-cell}
# Choose 500 times in the interval [0,35].

Now we use `plot!` to add to the current plot, rather than replacing it.
:::{card}
The `plot` function plots lines connecting the given $x$ and $y$ values; you can also specify markers at the points.

By convention, functions whose names end with the bang `!` change the value or state of something, in addition to possibly returning output.

:open: false

:::{index} ! Julia; size, ! Julia; length
:::

::::{grid} 1 1 2 2
In Julia, vectors and matrices are one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays, respectively. Square brackets are used to enclose elements of a matrix or vector. Use spaces for horizontal concatenation, and semicolons or new lines to indicate vertical concatenation.
:::{card}
The `size` function returns the number of rows and columns in a matrix. Use `length` to get the number of elements in a vector or matrix.
:::
::::


```{code-cell}
A = [ 1 2 3 4 5; 50 40 30 20 10
    π sqrt(2) exp(1) (1+sqrt(5))/2 log(3) ]
```

```{code-cell}
m, n = size(A)
```
A vector is not quite the same thing as a matrix: it has only one dimension, not two. Separate its elements by commas or semicolons:

```{code-cell}
x = [ 3, 3, 0, 1, 0 ]
size(x)
```

For some purposes, however, an $n$-vector in Julia is treated like having a column shape. Note the difference if we use spaces instead of commas inside the brackets:

```{code-cell}
y = [ 3 3 0 1 0 ]
size(y)
```

This $1\times 5$ matrix is not equivalent to a vector.

Concatenated elements within brackets may be matrices or vectors for a block representation, as long as all the block sizes are compatible.

```{code-cell}
[ x  x ]
```

```{code-cell}
[ x; x ]
```

The `zeros` and `ones` functions construct matrices with entries all zero or one, respectively.

```{code-cell}
B = [ zeros(3, 2) ones(3, 1) ]
```

```{index} ! Julia; transpose, ! Julia; adjoint, ! Julia; \'
```

A single quote `'` after a matrix returns its adjoint. For real matrices, this is the transpose; for complex-valued matrices, the elements are also conjugated. 

```{code-cell}
A'
```

If `x` is simply a vector, then its transpose has a row shape.

```{code-cell}
x'
```

```{index} ! Julia; range, ! Julia; \:
```

There are many convenient shorthand ways of building vectors and matrices other than entering all of their entries directly or in a loop. To get a range with evenly spaced entries between two endpoints, you have two options. One is to use a colon `:`.

```{code-cell}
y = 1:4              # start:stop
```

```{code-cell}
z = 0:3:12           # start:step:stop
```

(Ranges are not strictly considered vectors, but they behave identically in most circumstances.) Instead of specifying the step size, you can give the number of points in the range if you use `range`.

```{code-cell}
s = range(-1, 1, 5)
```

:::{index} ! Julia; end, ! Julia; indexing arrays
:::

::::{grid} 1 1 2 2
Accessing an element is done by giving one (for a vector) or two (for a matrix) index values within square brackets. 
:::{card}
The `end` keyword refers to the last element in a dimension. It saves you from having to compute and store the size of the matrix first.
::::

```{code-cell}
a = A[2, end-1]
```

```{code-cell}
x[2]
```

The indices can be vectors or ranges, in which case a block of the matrix is accessed.

```{code-cell}
A[1:2, end-2:end]    # first two rows, last three columns
```

```{index} Julia; \:

If a dimension has only the index `:` (a colon), then it refers to all the entries in that dimension of the matrix.

:::

::::{grid} 1 1 2 2
The matrix and vector senses of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, multiplication, and power are all handled by the usual symbols. 
:::{card}
Use `diagm` to construct a matrix by its diagonals. A more general syntax puts elements on super- or subdiagonals.
:::
::::

```{code-cell}
B = diagm( [-1, 0, -5] )   # create a diagonal matrix
```

```{code-cell}
@show size(A), size(B);
BA = B * A     # matrix product
```
::::{grid} 1 1 2 2
`A * B` causes an error here, because the dimensions aren't compatible.
:::{card}
Errors are formally called *exceptions* in Julia.
:::
::::

```{code-cell} julia
:tags: raises-exception
A * B    # throws an error
```

A square matrix raised to an integer power is the same as repeated matrix multiplication.

```{code-cell}
B^3    # same as B*B*B
```

Sometimes one instead wants to treat a matrix or vector as a mere array and simply apply a single operation to each element of it. For multiplication, division, and power, the corresponding operators start with a dot.

```{code-cell}
C = -A;
```

Because both matrices are $3\times 5$, `A * C` would be an error here, but elementwise operations are fine.

```{code-cell}
elementwise = A .* C
```

```{index} Julia; broadcasting
```

The two operands of a dot operator have to have the same size—unless one is a scalar, in which case it is expanded or *broadcast* to be the same size as the other operand.

```{code-cell}
x_to_two = x.^2
```

```{code-cell}
two_to_x = 2 .^ x
```

::::{grid} 1 1 2 2
Most of the mathematical functions, such as cos, sin, log, exp, and sqrt, expect scalars as operands. However, you can broadcast any function, including ones that you have defined, across a vector or array by using a special dot syntax.
:::{card}
A dot added to the end of a function name means to apply the function elementwise to an array.
:::
::::

```{code-cell}
show(cos.(π*x))    # broadcast to a function

Rather than dotting multiple individual functions, you can use `@.` before an expression to broadcast everything within it.

```{code-cell}
show(@. cos(π*(x+1)^3))    # broadcast an entire expression
```

For a square matrix $\mathbf{A}$, the syntax `A \ b` is mathematically equivalent to $\mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{b}$. 

```{code-cell}
A = [1 0 -1; 2 2 1; -1 -3 0]

```{code-cell}
b = [1, 2, 3]
```

```{code-cell}

One way to check the answer is to compute a quantity known as the **residual**. It is (ideally) close to machine precision (relative to the elements in the data).

```{code-cell}
residual = b - A*x
```

If the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is singular, you may get an error.

```{code-cell} julia
:tags: raises-exception
A = [0 1; 0 0]
b = [1, -1]
x = A \ b
```

::::{grid} 1 1 2 2
In this case we can check that the rank of $\mathbf{A}$ is less than its number of columns, indicating singularity.
:::{card}
The function `rank` computes the rank of a matrix. However, it is numerically unstable for matrices that are nearly singular, in a sense to be defined in a later section.
:::
::::

```{code-cell}
rank(A)
```

A linear system with a singular matrix might have no solution or infinitely many solutions, but in either case, backslash will fail. Moreover, detecting singularity is a lot like checking whether two floating-point numbers are *exactly* equal: because of roundoff, it could be missed. In {numref}`section-linsys-condition-number` we'll find a robust way to fully describe this situation.

Next we'll engineer a problem to which we know the exact answer. Use `\alpha` <kbd>Tab</kbd> and `\beta` <kbd>Tab</kbd> to get the Greek letters.

The notation `0=>ones(5)` creates a `Pair`. In `diagm`, pairs indicate the position of a diagonal and the elements that are to be placed on it.

```{code-cell}
α = 0.3;
β = 2.2;
U = diagm( 0=>ones(5), 1=>[-1, -1, -1, -1] )

U
```

```{code-cell}
x_exact = ones(5)
b = [α, 0, 0, 0, 1]
```

Now we use backward substitution to solve for $\mathbf{x}$, and compare to the exact solution we know already.

```{code-cell}
x = FNC.backsub(U,b)
err = x - x_exact
```

Everything seems OK here. But another example, with a different value for $\beta$, is more troubling.

```{code-cell}
α = 0.3;
β = 1e12;
U = diagm( 0=>ones(5), 1=>[-1, -1, -1, -1] )
U[1, [4, 5]] = [ α - β, β ]
b = [α, 0, 0, 0, 1]

x = FNC.backsub(U,b)
err = x - x_exact
```

It's not so good to get 4 digits of accuracy after starting with 16! The source of the error is not hard to track down. Solving for $x_1$ performs $(\alpha-\beta)+\beta$ in the first row. Since $|\alpha|$ is so much smaller than $|\beta|$, this a recipe for losing digits to subtractive cancellation.

Simply because of the triangular zero structures, only the first outer product contributes to the first row and first column of the entire product.

(demo-lu-derive-julia)=

For illustration, we work on a $4 \times 4$ matrix. We name it with a subscript in preparation for what comes.

```{code-cell}
A₁ = [

    -4    5   -7   -10

    -2    0    2   -13
    ];
L = diagm(ones(4))
U = zeros(4, 4);
```

Now we appeal to {eq}`outer-row1`. Since $L_{11}=1$, we see that the first row of $\mathbf{U}$ is just the first row of $\mathbf{A}_1$.

```{code-cell}
U[1, :] = A₁[1, :]
U
```

From {eq}`outer-col1`, we see that we can find the first column of $\mathbf{L}$ from the first column of $\mathbf{A}_1$. 

```{code-cell}
L[:, 1] = A₁[:, 1] / U[1, 1]
L
```

 We have obtained the first term in the sum {eq}`matrixouter` for $\mathbf{L}\mathbf{U}$, and we subtract it away from $\mathbf{A}_1$.

```{code-cell}
A₂ = A₁ - L[:, 1] * U[1, :]'
```

Now $\mathbf{A}_2 = \boldsymbol{\ell}_2\mathbf{u}_2^T + \boldsymbol{\ell}_3\mathbf{u}_3^T + \boldsymbol{\ell}_4\mathbf{u}_4^T.$ If we ignore the first row and first column of the matrices in this equation, then in what remains we are in the same situation as at the start. Specifically, only $\boldsymbol{\ell}_2\mathbf{u}_2^T$ has any effect on the second row and column, so we can deduce them now.

```{code-cell}
U[2, :] = A₂[2, :]
L[:, 2] = A₂[:, 2] / U[2, 2]
L
```

If we subtract off the latest outer product, we have a matrix that is zero in the first *two* rows and columns. 

```{code-cell}
A₃ = A₂ - L[:, 2] * U[2, :]'
```

Now we can deal with the lower right $2\times 2$ submatrix of the remainder in a similar fashion.

```{code-cell}
U[3, :] = A₃[3, :]
L[:, 3] = A₃[:, 3] / U[3, 3]
A₄ = A₃ - L[:, 3] * U[3, :]'
```

Finally, we pick up the last unknown in the factors.

```{code-cell}
U[4, 4] = A₄[4, 4];
```

We now have all of $\mathbf{L}$,

```{code-cell} 
L
```

and all of $\mathbf{U}$,

```{code-cell}
U
```

We can verify that we have a correct factorization of the original matrix by computing the backward error:

```{code-cell} 
A₁ - L * U
```

IIn floating point, we cannot expect the difference to be exactly zero as we found in this toy example. Instead, we would be satisfied to see that each element of the difference above is comparable in size to machine precision.

```{admonition} About the code
:class: dropdown
Line 11 of {numref}`Function {number} <function-lufact>` points out two subtle Julia issues. First, vectors and matrix variables are really just references to blocks of memory. Such a reference is much more efficient to pass around than the complete contents of the array. However, it means that a statement `Aₖ=A` just clones the array reference of `A` into the variable `Aₖ`. Any changes made to entries of `Aₖ` would then also be made to entries of `A` because they refer to the same location in memory. In this context we don't want to change the original matrix, so we use `copy` here to create an independent copy of the array contents and a new reference to them.

The second issue is that even when `A` has all integer entries, its LU factors may not. So we convert `Aₖ` to floating point so that line 17 will not fail due to the creation of floating-point values in an integer matrix. An alternative would be to require the caller to provide a floating-point array in the first place.

Since the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ has $n^2$ elements, all of which have to be involved in the product, it seems unlikely that we could get a flop count that is smaller than $O(n^2)$ in general.

Let's run an experiment with the built-in matrix-vector multiplication. Note that Julia is unusual in that loops have a variable scope separate from its enclosing code. Thus, `for n in n` below means that inside the loop, the name `n` will take on each one of the values that were previously assigned to the vector `n`.

The reason for doing multiple repetitions at each value of $n$ in the loop above is to avoid having times so short that the resolution of the timer is significant.

Here is a previously encountered matrix that factors well.

If we swap the second and fourth rows of $\mathbf{A}$, the result is still nonsingular. However, the factorization now fails.

The presence of `NaN` in the result indicates that some impossible operation was required. The source of the problem is easy to locate. We can find the first outer product in the factorization just fine:

```{code-cell}
U[1, :] = A[1, :]
L[:, 1] = A[:, 1] / U[1, 1]
A -= L[:, 1] * U[1, :]'
```

The next step is `U[2, :] = A[2, :]`, which is also OK. But then we are supposed to divide by `U[2, 2]`, which is zero. The algorithm cannot continue.

This is the row of the matrix that we extract to put into $\mathbf{U}$. That guarantees that the division used to find $\boldsymbol{\ell}_1$ will be valid.

```{code-cell}
L, U = zeros(4,4),zeros(4,4)
U[1, :] = A₁[i, :]
L[:, 1] = A₁[:, 1] / U[1, 1]
A₂ = A₁ - L[:, 1] * U[1, :]'

Observe that $\mathbf{A}_2$ has a new zero row and zero column, but the zero row is the fourth rather than the first. However, we forge on by using the largest possible pivot in column 2 for the next outer product.

```{code-cell}
@show i = argmax( abs.(A₂[:, 2]) ) 
U[2, :] = A₂[i, :]
L[:, 2] = A₂[:, 2] / U[2, 2]
A₃ = A₂ - L[:, 2] * U[2, :]'

Now we have zeroed out the third row as well as the second column. We can finish out the procedure.

```{code-cell}
@show i = argmax( abs.(A₃[:, 3]) ) 
U[3, :] = A₃[i, :]
L[:, 3] = A₃[:, 3] / U[3, 3]

We do have a factorization of the original matrix:

In Julia, one uses `norm` for vector norms and for the Frobenius norm of a matrix, which is like stacking the matrix into a single vector before taking the 2-norm. 

```{code-cell}
Fronorm = norm(A)
```

```{index} ! Julia; opnorm

Most of the time we want to use `opnorm`, which is an induced matrix norm. The default is the 2-norm.

You can get the 1-norm as well.

Use `sum` to sum along a dimension of a matrix. You can also sum over the entire matrix by omitting the `dims` argument.

The `maximum` and `minimum` functions also work along one dimension or over an entire matrix. To get both values at once, use `extrema`.
:::

```{code-cell}
# Sum down the rows (1st matrix dimension):
maximum( sum(abs.(A), dims=1) )

To create an array of plots, start with a `plot` that has a `layout` argument, then do subsequent `plot!` calls with a `subplot` argument.

```

The linear function $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$ defines a mapping from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$. We can apply `A` to every column of `x` by using a single matrix multiplication.

```{code-cell}
Ax = A * x;

The image of the transformed vectors is an ellipse.

::::{grid} 1 1 2 2
Julia has a function `cond` to compute matrix condition numbers. By default, the 2-norm is used. As an example, the family of *Hilbert matrices* is famously badly conditioned. Here is the $6\times 6$  case.
:::{card}
Type `\kappa` followed by <kbd>Tab</kbd> to get the Greek letter $\kappa$.
:::
::::

```{code-cell}
A = [ 1 / (i + j) for i in 1:6, j in 1:6 ]
κ = cond(A)
```

Because $\kappa\approx 10^8$, it's possible to lose nearly 8 digits of accuracy in the process of passing from $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ to $\mathbf{x}$. That fact is independent of the algorithm; it's inevitable once the data are expressed in finite precision. 

Let's engineer a linear system problem to observe the effect of a perturbation. We will make sure we know the exact answer.

```{code-cell}
x = 1:6
b = A * x
```

Now we perturb the system matrix and vector randomly by $10^{-10}$ in norm.

```{code-cell} 
# type \Delta then Tab to get Δ
ΔA = randn(size(A));  ΔA = 1e-10 * (ΔA / opnorm(ΔA));
Δb = randn(size(b));  Δb = 1e-10 * normalize(Δb);
```

We solve the perturbed problem using pivoted LU and see how the solution was changed.

```{code-cell}
new_x = ((A + ΔA) \ (b + Δb))
Δx = new_x - x
```

Here is the relative error in the solution.

```{code-cell}
@show relative_error = norm(Δx) / norm(x);
```

And here are upper bounds predicted using the condition number of the original matrix.

```{code-cell}
println("Upper bound due to b: $(κ * norm(Δb) / norm(b))")
println("Upper bound due to A: $(κ * opnorm(ΔA) / opnorm(A))")
```

Even if we didn't make any manual perturbations to the data, machine roundoff does so at the relative level of $\macheps$.

```{code-cell}
Δx = A\b - x
@show relative_error = norm(Δx) / norm(x);
@show rounding_bound = κ * eps();
```

Larger Hilbert matrices are even more poorly conditioned:

```{code-cell}
A = [ 1 / (i + j) for i=1:14, j=1:14 ];
κ = cond(A)
```

Note that $\kappa$ exceeds $1/\macheps$. In principle we therefore may end up with an answer that has relative error greater than 100%.

```{code-cell}
rounding_bound = κ*eps()
```

Let's put that prediction to the test.

```{code-cell}
x = 1:14
b = A * x  
Δx = A\b - x
@show relative_error = norm(Δx) / norm(x);

As anticipated, the solution has zero accurate digits in the 2-norm.
