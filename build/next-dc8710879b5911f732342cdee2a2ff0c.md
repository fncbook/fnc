The numerical solution of advection and wave equations, particularly nonlinear conservation laws, is still an active area of research.  A more detailed treatment on finite-difference methods for scalar problems is in {cite}`levequeFiniteDifference2007`.  An accessible treatment of nonlinear conservation laws can be found in {cite}`levequeNumericalMethods1992`.  Recent monographs aimed at hyperbolic PDEs, both scalar equations and systems, are from {cite}`trangensteinNumericalSolution2009` and {cite}`levequeFiniteVolume2002`.

A wide-ranging view of computational mathematics relating to conservation laws (in many cases, nonlinear versions of the advection equation) can be found in [Peter Lax's oral history](http://history.siam.org/oralhistories/lax.htm).
