(demo-polynomial-lagrange-matlab)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-polynomial-lagrange
:open:
Here is a vector of nodes.

```{code-cell}
t = [ 1, 1.5, 2, 2.25, 2.75, 3 ];
n = 5;  k = 2;
not_k = [0:k-1 k+1:n];   % all except the kth node
```

Let's apply the definition of the cardinal Lagrange polynomial for $k=2$. First we define a polynomial $q$ that is zero at all the nodes except $i=k$. Then $\ell_2$ is found by normalizing $q$ by $q(t_k)$.
```{tip}
:class: dropdown
Whenever we index into the node vector `t`, we have to add 1 since the mathematical index starts at zero.
```

```{code-cell}
q = @(x) prod(x - t(not_k + 1));
ell_k = @(x) q(x) ./ q(t(k + 1));

```

A plot confirms the cardinal property of the result.

```{code-cell}
clf
fplot(ell_k, [1, 3])
hold on, grid on
plot(t(not_k + 1), 0 * t(not_k + 1), 'o')
plot(t(k + 1), 1, 'o')

Observe that $\ell_k$ is _not_ between zero and one everywhere, unlike a hat function.

hold on,  plot(t, 0*t, 'o')
xlabel('x'),  ylabel('\Phi(x)')   
title('Interpolation error function')   
```

The error is zero at the nodes, by the definition of interpolation. The error bound, as well as the error itself, has one local maximum between each consecutive pair of nodes.

### 9.2 @section-globalapprox-barycentric

We start with 4 equally spaced nodes ($n=3$).

```{code-cell}
t = linspace(0, 1, 4)'; 
y = f(t);
p = polyinterp(t, y);
hold on,  fplot(p, [0, 1], displayname="interpolant on 4 nodes")
scatter(t, y, 'k', displayname="nodes")
```

The curves always intersect at the interpolation nodes. For $n=6$, the interpolant is noticeably better.

```{code-cell}

We choose a function over the interval $[0,1]$. Using 7 equally spaced nodes, the interpolation looks fine.

```{code-cell}

```

We want to track the behavior of the error as $n$ increases. We will estimate the error in the continuous interpolant by sampling it at a large number of points and taking the max-norm.

```{code-cell} 
:tags: hide-input
n = (5:5:60)';   
err = zeros(size(n));
x = linspace(0, 1, 1001)';         % for measuring error
for k = 1:length(n) 
  t = linspace(0, 1, n(k) + 1)';     % equally spaced nodes
  y = f(t);                      % interpolation data
  p = polyinterp(t, y);
  err(k) = norm(f(x) - p(x), Inf);
end
clf,  semilogy(n, err, 'o-')
xlabel('n'),  ylabel('max error')   
title('Equispaced polynomial interpolation error')   
```

The error initially decreases as one would expect but then begins to grow. Both phases occur at rates that are exponential in $n$, i.e., $O(K^n$) for a constant $K$, appearing linear on a semi-log plot.

We plot $|\Phi(x)|$ over the interval $[-1,1]$ with equispaced nodes for different values of $n$.

Each time $\Phi$ passes through zero at an interpolation node, the value on the log scale should go to $-\infty$, which explains the numerous cusps on the curves.

This function has infinitely many continuous derivatives on the entire real line and looks easy to approximate over $[-1,1]$.

We start by doing equispaced polynomial interpolation for some small values of $n$.

end
title('Error for degrees 4, 8, 12')

```

The convergence so far appears rather good, though not uniformly so. However, notice what happens as we continue to increase the degree.

```{code-cell} 
:tags: hide-input

end
title('Error for degrees 27, 42, 57')   
xlabel('x'), ylabel('|f(x) - p(x)|')   
```

The convergence in the middle can't get any better than machine precision relative to the function values. So maintaining the growing gap between the center and the ends pushes the error curves upward exponentially fast at the ends, wrecking the convergence.

Now we look at the error indicator function $\Phi$ for Chebyshev node sets.

By degree 16 the error is uniformly within machine epsilon, and, importantly, it stays there as $n$ increases. Note that as predicted by the error indicator function, the error is uniform over the interval at each value of $n$.

``````{dropdown} @demo-orthogonal-approx
:open:
Let's approximate $e^x$ over the interval $[−1,1]$. We can sample it at, say, 15 points, and find the best-fitting straight line to that data.

There's nothing special about 15 points. Choosing more doesn't change the result much.

```{code-cell}
t = linspace(-1, 1, 150)';
y = exp(t);
V = [t.^0, t];
c = V \ y;
p = @(t) c(1) + c(2)*t;
fplot(p, [-1, 1], displayname="LS fit at 150 points")
```

This situation is unlike interpolation, where the degree of the interpolant increases with the number of nodes. Here, the linear fit is apparently approaching a limit that we may think of as a continuous least-squares fit.

```{code-cell}
n = (40:60:400)';
slope = zeros(size(n));

### 9.5 @section-globalapprox-trig

(demo-trig-interp-matlab)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-trig-interp

We will get a cardinal function without using an explicit formula, just by passing data that is 1 at one node and 0 at the others.

Here is a 2-periodic function and one of its interpolants.

The convergence of the interpolant is spectral. We let $N$ go needlessly large here in order to demonstrate that unlike polynomials, trigonometric interpolation is stable on equally spaced nodes. Note that when $N$ is even, the value of $n$ is not an integer but works fine for defining the nodes.

This function has frequency content at $2\pi$, $-2\pi$, and $\pi$. 

```{code-cell}
f = @(x) 3 * cos(2*pi * x) - exp(1i*pi * x);
```

To use `fft`, we set up nodes in the interval $[0,2)$. 

```{code-cell}
n = 4;
N = 2*n + 1;
t = 2 * (0:N-1)' / N;      % nodes in $[0,2)$
y = f(t);
```

We perform Fourier analysis using `fft` and then examine the resulting coefficients.

```{code-cell}
c = fft(y) / N;
freq = [0:n, -n:-1]';
format short
disp(table(freq, c, variableNames=["k", "coefficient"]))
```

Note that $1.5 e^{2i\pi x}+1.5 e^{-2i\pi x} = 3 \cos(2\pi x)$, so this result is sensible.

Fourier's greatest contribution to mathematics was to point out that *every* periodic function is just a combination of frequencies—infinitely many of them in general, but truncated for computational use. Here we look at the magnitudes of the coefficients for $f(x) = \exp( \sin(\pi x) )$.

```{code-cell}
:tags: hide-input
f = @(x) exp( sin(pi*x) );    % content at all frequencies
n = 9;  N = 2*n + 1;
t = 2 * (0:N-1)' / N;         % nodes in $[0,2)$
y = f(t);
c = fft(y) / N;
freq = [0:n, -n:-1]';

clf
semilogy(freq, abs(c), 'o')
xlabel('k'),  ylabel('|c_k|')

The Fourier coefficients of smooth functions decay exponentially in magnitude as a function of the frequency. This decay rate is determines the convergence of the interpolation error.

We compare the two spectral integration methods for a range of $n$ values.

xlabel('number of nodes'),  ylabel('error')
title('Spectral integration')

```

(The missing points are where the error is exactly zero.) Gauss–Legendre does converge faster here, but at something less than twice the rate.

Now we try a more sharply peaked integrand:
 
 $$\int_{-1}^1 \frac{1}{1+16x^2} \, dx = \frac{1}{2}\arctan(4).$$ 

```{code-cell}
f = @(x) 1 ./ (1 + 16*x.^2);

errGL = zeros(size(n));

  errCC(k) = exact - ccint(f, n(k));
  errGL(k) = exact - glint(f, n(k));

xlabel('number of nodes'),  ylabel('error')
title('Spectral integration')   
legend('Clenshaw–Curtis', 'Gauss–Legendre')   
```

The two are very close until about $n=40$, when the Clenshaw–Curtis method slows down.

Now let's compare the spectral performance to that of our earlier adaptive method in `intadapt`. We will specify varying error tolerances and record the error as well as the total number of evaluations of $f$.

```{code-cell}
:tags: hide-input
tol = 10 .^ (-2:-2:-14)';
n = zeros(size(tol));  
errAdapt = zeros(size(tol));
for k = 1:length(n)
  [Q, t] = intadapt(f, -1, 1, tol(k));
  errAdapt(k) = exact - Q;
  n(k) = length(t);
end
hold on;  semilogy(n, abs(errAdapt), 'o-')
plot(n, n.^(-4), 'k--')        % 4th order error
set(gca, 'xscale', 'log')     
legend('ccint', 'glint', 'intadapt', '4th order')  
title(('Spectral vs 4th order'));
```

At the core of `intadapt` is a fourth-order formula, and the results track that rate closely. For all but the most relaxed error tolerances, both spectral methods are far more efficient than the low-order counterpart. For other integrands, particularly those that vary nonuniformly across the interval, the adaptive method might be more competitive.
