# Setting up Julia for this book

Julia, and all the packages this book depends on, is free and open-source. Much of the functionality outside the core is distributed via packages that need to be installed once per system.

## Installing Julia

To install Julia, go to the [Julia website](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system. Any 1.x version at 1.11 or greater should be fine. I strongly recommend using the `juliaup` version manager rather than manually downloading and installing the application. 

## Installing the book's functions

When you start Julia, you will see a prompt that looks like this:

```julia
julia>
```

It is waiting for you to enter commands that will be executed right away. To enter package management mode, type `]` (the `]` key) and you will see the prompt change to something like this:

```julia
(@v1.11) pkg>
```

Now you enter `add FNCFunctions` and press `Enter`. This will install the functions that are used in this book. It may take a few minutes to download and install everything. This is a one-time operation.

When you are done with package management, type {kdb}`delete` or a backspace to return to the normal Julia prompt.

## Using packages

Julia offers both `import` and `using` as ways to load packages. The difference is that `import` loads a package into its own namespace, so that you have to refer to its functions with a prefix. For example:

``` julia-repl
julia> import Statistics

julia> mean
ERROR: UndefVarError: `mean` not defined in `Main`
Suggestion: check for spelling errors or missing imports.
Hint: a global variable of this name also exists in Statistics.

julia> Statistics.mean
mean (generic function with 6 methods)
```

If you use `using` rather than `import`, then the package *may* also make its functions available in the global namespace. For example:

``` julia-repl
julia> using Statistics

julia> mean
mean (generic function with 6 methods)
```

This is convenient for functions that you will call frequently, but it can lead to name conflicts if you are not careful. The package written for this book do *not* go into the global namespace. This is a deliberate reminder that they are for learning purposes only and not meant as tools for serious work. The package does define a shortcut called `FNC`, though, so you can write `FNC.lufact` instead of `FNCFunctions.lufact`.

## Installing other packages

Julia comes with a few core packages such as `Statistics` and `LinearAlgebra` that you can use right away. But if you try `import` or `using` at the prompt with an unknown package, you will get a message like this:

```julia-repl
julia> using Plots
 │ Package Plots not found, but a package named Plots is available from a registry. 
 │ Install package?
 │   (@v1.11) pkg> add Plots 
 └ (y/n/o) [y]: 
```

If you answer `y`, then the package will be downloaded and installed. You can also install packages from the prompt manually by typing `] add PackageName`. For example, to install the `Plots` package, you would type `] add Plots`.

## Packages used in the book

In order to avoid repeating low-information code, the book demos are run with a few packages installed and always imported:

- `FNCFunctions`
- `Printf`, `LinearAlgebra` (part of the default Julia installation)
- `Plots`, `PrettyTables`, `LaTeXStrings` (external packages)

Of the external packages, `Plots` is essential for the exercises, while the others are used to make the results look nicer in the book.

Throughout the book demos there are other external packages loaded by `using` as needed. These include:

- `Arpack`
- `BoundaryValueDiffEq`
- `Dierckx`
- `FFTW`
- `GraphRecipes`
- `Images`
- `IncompleteLU`
- `IterativeSolvers`
- `JLD2`
- `LinearMaps`
- `MatrixDepot`
- `NLsolve`
- `OrdinaryDiffEq`
- `Polynomials`
- `Preconditioners`
- `QuadGK`
- `SpecialFunctions`
- `TestImages`

You could simply install all of these at once and be done with them; except for the ones dealing with differential equations, they are pretty quick to install.
