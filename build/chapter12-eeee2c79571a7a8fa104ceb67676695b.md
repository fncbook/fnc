 In the following definition we allow the velocity $c$ to be specified as a parameter.

```{code-cell}
[x, Dx, Dxx] = diffper(300, [-4, 4]);
f = @(t, u, c) -c * (Dx*u);
ivp = ode(ODEFcn=f);
ivp.Parameters = 2;
ivp.InitialTime = 0;
ivp.RelativeTolerance = 1e-5;
```

The following initial condition isn't mathematically periodic, but the deviation is less than machine precision. We specify RK4 as the solver.  

```{code-cell}
u_init = 1 + exp(-3*x.^2);
ivp.InitialValue = u_init;
t = linspace(0, 3, 201);
sol = solve(ivp, t);
U = sol.Solution;
```

```{code-cell}

```

An animation shows the solution nicely. The bump moves with speed 2 to the right, reentering on the left as it exits to the right because of the periodic conditions.

The following are parameters and a function relevant to defining the problem. 

```{code-cell}
rho_c = 1080;  rho_m = 380;  q_m = 10000;
Q0prime = @(rho) 4*q_m*rho_c^2 * (rho_c - rho_m) * rho_m ...
    *(rho_m - rho) ./ ((rho_c - 2*rho_m) * rho + rho_c * rho_m).^3;
ep = 0.02;
```

Here we create a discretization on $m=800$ points.

```{code-cell}
[x, Dx, Dxx] = diffper(800, [0, 4]);
```

Next we define the ODE resulting from the method of lines.

```{code-cell}
odefun = @(t, rho) -Q0prime(rho) .* (Dx*rho) + ep * (Dxx*rho);
ivp = ode(ODEFcn=odefun);
ivp.InitialTime = 0;
ivp.RelativeTolerance = 1e-5;
```

Our first initial condition has moderate density with a small bump. Because of the diffusion present, we use a stiff solver for the IVP.

```{code-cell}
rho_init = 400 + 10 * exp(-20*(x-3).^2);
ivp.InitialValue = rho_init;

t = linspace(0, 1, 101);
sol = solve(ivp, t);
RHO = sol.Solution;
```

```{code-cell}
:tags: hide-input
clf
for plot_idx = 1:20:101
    str = sprintf("t = %.2f", t(plot_idx));
    plot(x, RHO(:, plot_idx), displayname=str)
    hold on
end
xlabel('x'),  ylabel('car density')
title('Traffic flow')

```

The bump slowly moves backward on the roadway, spreading out and gradually fading away due to the presence of diffusion.

```{code-cell}

plot(x, RHO(:, 1))
hold on,  grid on

    str = sprintf("t = %.2f", t(frame));
    text(0.2, 409, str);
    writeVideo(vid, frame2im(getframe(gcf)));
end
close(vid)
```

![Traffic flow](figures/traffic-small.mp4)

Now we use an initial condition with a larger bump. Note that the scale on the $y$-axis is much different for this solution.

```{code-cell}
rho_init = 400 + 80 * exp( -16*(x - 3).^2 );
ivp.InitialValue = rho_init;
t = linspace(0, 0.5, 81);
sol = solve(ivp, t);
RHO = sol.Solution;
```

```{code-cell}

for plot_idx = 1:16:81
    str = sprintf("t = %.2f", t(plot_idx));
    plot(x, RHO(:, plot_idx), displayname=str)
    hold on
end
xlabel('x'),  ylabel('car density')
title('Traffic jam')

```

```{code-cell}

vid = VideoWriter("figures/traffic-jam.mp4", "MPEG-4");
vid.Quality = 85;
open(vid);
for frame = 1:length(t)
    cla, plot(x, RHO(:, frame))
    str = sprintf("t = %.2f", t(frame));
    text(0.2, 470, str);
    writeVideo(vid, frame2im(getframe(gcf)));
end
close(vid)
```

In this case the density bump travels backward along the road. It also steepens on the side facing the incoming traffic and decreases much more slowly on the other side. A motorist would experience this as an abrupt increase in density, followed by a much more gradual decrease in density and resulting gradual increase in speed. (You also see some transient, high-frequency oscillations. These are caused by instabilities, as we discuss in simpler situations later in this chapter.)

In the space-time plot above, you can see the initial hump traveling rightward at constant speed. It fully traverses the domain once for each integer multiple of $t=1/2$. 

If we cut $h$ by a factor of 2 (i.e., double $m$), then the CFL condition suggests that the time step should be cut by a factor of 2 also.

```{code-cell}
num_steps_400 = length(sol.Time) - 1

[x, Dx] = diffper(800, [0, 1]);
ivp.ODEFcn = @(t, u) -c * (Dx*u);
ivp.InitialValue = exp( -80*(x - 0.5).^2 );
[u, sol] = solutionFcn(ivp, 0, 2);

num_steps_800 = length(sol.Time) - 1
ratio = num_steps_800 / num_steps_400
```

:open:
If we solve advection over $[0,1]$ with velocity $c=-1$, the right boundary is in the upwind/inflow direction. Thus a well-posed boundary condition is $u(1,t)=0$.

We'll pattern a solution after {numref}`Function {number} <function-parabolic>`. Since $u(x_m,t)=0$, we define the ODE interior problem {eq}`mol-interior` for $\mathbf{v}$ without $u_m$. For each evaluation of $\mathbf{v}'$, we must extend the data back to $x_m$ first.

```{code-cell}
m = 100;  c = -1;
[x, Dx] = diffmat2(m, [0, 1]);
chop = @(u) u(1:m);  
extend = @(v) [v; 0];
odefun = @(t, v) -c * chop( Dx * extend(v) );
ivp = ode(ODEFcn = odefun);
ivp.RelativeTolerance = 1e-5;
ivp.InitialTime = 0;
```

Now we solve for an initial condition that has a single hump.

```{code-cell}
u_init = exp( -80*(x - 0.5).^2 );
ivp.InitialValue = chop(u_init);
sol = solutionFcn(ivp, 0, 1);
u = @(t) [sol(t); zeros(1, length(t))];    % extend to zero at right
```

```{code-cell}

clf,  contour(x, t, u(t)', 0.15:0.2:1)
xlabel x,  ylabel t
title('Advection with inflow BC')

We find that the hump gracefully exits out the downwind end.

```{code-cell}

    writeVideo(vid, frame2im(getframe(gcf)));
end
close(vid)
```

![Advection with inflow BC](figures/advection-inflow.mp4)

If instead of $u(1,t)=0$ we were to try to impose the downwind condition $u(0,t)=0$, we only need to change the index of the interior nodes and where to append the zero value.

```{code-cell}
chop = @(u) u(2:m+1);  
extend = @(v) [0; v];
ivp.ODEFcn = @(t, v) -c * chop( Dx * extend(v) );
ivp.InitialValue = chop(u_init);
sol = solutionFcn(ivp, 0, 1);
u = @(t) [zeros(1, length(t)); sol(t)];

contour(x, t, u(t)', 0.15:0.2:1)

title('Advection with outflow BC')
```

This time, the solution blows up as soon as the hump runs into the boundary because there are conflicting demands there.

For $c=1$ we get purely imaginary eigenvalues.

Let's choose a time step of $\tau=0.1$ and compare to the stability regions of the Euler and backward Euler time steppers (shown as shaded regions):

```{code-cell}
:tags: hide-input
zc = exp( 1i * linspace(0,2*pi,361)' );    % points on |z|=1
z = zc - 1;    % shift circle left by 1
clf,  fill(real(z), imag(z), [.8, .8, 1])
hold on,  scatter(real(0.1*lambda), imag(0.1*lambda))
axis equal,  axis square
axis([-5, 5, -5, 5]),  grid on
title('Euler')
```

In the Euler case it's clear that *no* real value of $\tau>0$ is going to make $\zeta$ values fit within the stability region. Any method whose stability region includes none of the imaginary axis is an unsuitable choice for advection.

```{code-cell}
:tags: hide-input
clf,  fill([-6, 6, 6, -6],[-6, -6, 6, 6], [.8, .8, 1])
z = zc + 1;   % shift circle right by 1

fill(real(z), imag(z), 'w')
axis equal,  axis square
axis([-5 5 -5 5]),  grid on
title('backward Euler')

The A-stable backward Euler time stepping tells the exact opposite story: it will be absolutely stable for any choice of the time step $\tau$.

Consequently all solutions decay exponentially to zero as $t\to\infty$. This matches our observation of the solution: eventually, everything flows out of the domain.

The boundary values of $u$ are given to be zero, so they are not unknowns in the ODEs. Instead they are added or removed as necessary.

```{code-cell}
chop = @(u) u(2:m);
extend = @(v) [0; v; 0];

The following function computes the time derivative of the system at interior points.

```{literalinclude} f124wave.m

Our initial condition is a single hump for $u$.

```{code-cell}
u_init = exp( -100*x.^2 );
z_init = -u_init;
w_init = [ chop(u_init); z_init ];  
```

Because the wave equation is hyperbolic, we can use a nonstiff explicit solver.

```{code-cell}
ivp = ode(ODEFcn=@f124wave);
ivp.InitialTime = 0;
ivp.InitialValue = w_init;
ivp.RelativeTolerance = 1e-4;

t = linspace(0, 2, 101);

The original hump breaks into two pieces of different amplitudes, each traveling with speed $c=2$. They pass through one another without interference. When a hump encounters a boundary, it is perfectly reflected, but with inverted shape. At time $t=2$, the solution looks just like the initial condition.
