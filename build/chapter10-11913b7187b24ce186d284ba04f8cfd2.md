### 10.1 @section-bvp-tpbvp

(demo-tpbvp-mems-matlab)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-tpbvp-mems
:open:
```{index} ! Julia; in-place function
```

To define the BVP, we need to define some functions. (For this simple problem, we will use anonymous functions, but for a more substantial one, it would be better to use separate files.) The first defines $\mathbf{f}(x, \mathbf{y})$. 

```{code-cell}
lambda = 0.6;
bvpfcn = @(r, y) [ y(2); lambda / y(1)^2 - y(2) / r  ];    % column vector
```

Our second function defines the boundary conditions. It takes $\mathbf{y}(a)$ and $\mathbf{y}(b)$ as arguments and returns a vector of residuals; i.e., values that should be zero when the boundary conditions are satisfied. 

```{code-cell}
bcfcn = @(ya, yb) [ ya(2); yb(1) - 1 ];    % y_2(a) = 0;  y_1(b) = 1
```

The third function we define isn't part of the mathematical formulation. Rather, it provides an initial guess for the solution. Here we choose both components to be constant.

```{code-cell}
y_init = @(r) [ 1; 0 ];
```

Now we can solve the BVP using the `bvp4c` function. We need to specify the nodes on which to solve the problem. The domain of the mathematical problem is $r\in [0,1]$.But since there is a division by $r$ in the ODE, we want to avoid $r=0$ by truncating the domain a tiny bit.

```{code-cell}
nodes = linspace(eps, 1, 61);
sol_init = bvpinit(nodes, y_init);
sol = bvp4c(bvpfcn, bcfcn, sol_init);
plot(sol.x, sol.y, '-o')
xlabel('r'), ylabel('y(r)')
title('Solution of the membrane problem')
legend("w(r)", "w'(r)", location="east");
```

It's smart to check visually that the boundary conditions are satisfied.

### 10.2 @section-bvp-shooting
(demo-shooting-naive-matlab)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-shooting-naive
:open:
Let's first examine the shooting approach for the TPBVP from {numref}`Example {number} <example-tpbvp-mems>` with $\lambda=0.6$. 

```{code-cell}
lambda = 0.6;
phi = @(r, w, dwdr) lambda ./ w.^2 - dwdr ./ r;
```

We convert the ODE to a first-order system in order to apply a numerical method. We also have to truncate the domain to avoid division by zero.

```{code-cell}
f = @(r, w) [ w(2); phi(r, w(1), w(2)) ];
a = eps;  b = 1;
```

The BVP specifies $w'(0)=y_2(0)=0$. We can try multiple values for the unknown $w(0)=y_1(0)$ and plot the solutions.

```{code-cell}
clf
ivp = ode;
ivp.ODEFcn = f;
ivp.InitialTime = a;
for w0 = 0.4:0.1:0.9
    ivp.InitialValue = [w0; 0];
    sol = solve(ivp, a, b);
    plot(sol.Time, sol.Solution(1, :))
    hold on
end
xlabel('r'),  ylabel('w(r)')
title('Solutions for multiple choices of w(0)')
```

On the graph, it's the curve starting at $w(0)=0.8$ that comes closest to the required condition $w(1)=1$, but it's a bit too large.
``````

(demo-shooting-mems-matlab)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-shooting-mems
:open:
We revisit {numref}`Demo {number} <demo-shooting-naive>` but let {numref}`Function {number} <function-shoot>` do the heavy lifting.

```{code-cell}
lambda = 0.6;
phi = @(r, w, dwdr) lambda ./ w.^2 - dwdr ./ r;   
a = eps;  b = 1;    % avoid r=0 in denominator
```

We specify the given and unknown endpoint values.

```{code-cell}
ga = @(u, du) du;
gb = @(u, du) u - 1;
```

```{code-cell}
init = [0.8; 0];    % initial guess for u(a) and u'(a)
[r, w, dwdx] = shoot(phi, a, b, ga, gb, init, 1e-5);
clf,  plot(r, w)
title('Correct solution')
xlabel('r'),  ylabel('w(r)')
```

The value of $w$ at $r=1$, meant to be exactly one, was computed to be

```{code-cell}
format long
w(end)
```

The accuracy is consistent with the error tolerance used for the IVP solution. The initial value $w(0)$ that gave this solution is

```{code-cell}
w(1)
```

    hold on
    xlabel('x'),  ylabel('u(x)')

The numerical solution fails at the largest value of $\lambda$ because the initial condition became infinite.

### 10.3 @section-bvp-diffmats
(demo-diffmats-2nd-matlab)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-diffmats-2nd
:open:
We test first-order and second-order differentiation matrices for the function $x + \exp(\sin 4x)$ over $[-1,1]$.

```{code-cell}
f = @(x) x + exp(sin(4*x));
```

For reference, here are the exact first and second derivatives.

```{code-cell}
df_dx = @(x) 1 + 4 * exp(sin(4*x)) .* cos(4*x);
d2f_dx2 = @(x) 4 * exp(sin(4*x)) .* (4*cos(4*x).^2 - 4*sin(4*x));
```

We discretize on equally spaced nodes and evaluate $f$ at the nodes.

```{code-cell}
[t, Dx, Dxx] = diffmat2(12, [-1 1]);
y = f(t);
```

Then the first two derivatives of $f$ each require one matrix-vector multiplication.

```{code-cell}
yx = Dx * y;
yxx = Dxx * y;
```

The results show poor accuracy for this small value of $n$.

```{code-cell}
clf,  subplot(2, 1, 1)
fplot(df_dx, [-1, 1]),  hold on
plot(t, yx, 'ko')
xlabel('x'),  ylabel('f''(x)')
subplot(2, 1, 2)
fplot(d2f_dx2, [-1, 1]),  hold on
plot(t, yxx, 'ko')
xlabel('x'),  ylabel('f''''(x)')
```

An convergence experiment confirms the order of accuracy. Because we expect an algebraic convergence rate, we use a log-log plot of the errors.

```{code-cell}
n = round( 2 .^ (4:.5:11)' );
err = zeros(length(n), 2);
for k = 1:length(n)
    [t, Dx, Dxx] = diffmat2(n(k), [-1, 1]);
    y = f(t);
    err(k, 1) = norm(df_dx(t) - Dx * y, Inf);
    err(k, 2) = norm(d2f_dx2(t) - Dxx * y, Inf);
end
clf
loglog(n, err, 'o-'), hold on
loglog(n, 100 * n.^(-2), 'k--')

We again test the convergence rate.

```{code-cell}
f = @(x) x + exp(sin(4*x));
df_dx = @(x) 1 + 4 * exp(sin(4*x)) .* cos(4*x);
d2f_dx2 = @(x) 4 * exp(sin(4*x)) .* (4*cos(4*x).^2 - 4*sin(4*x));

    err(k, 2) = norm(d2f_dx2(t) - Dxx * y, Inf);

```

Since we expect a spectral convergence rate, we use a semi-log plot for the error.

```{code-cell}

The problem is presented above in our standard form, so we can identify the coefficient functions in the ODE. Each should be coded as a function.

```{code-cell}
p = @(x) -cos(x);
q = @(x) sin(x);
r = @(x) 0*x;      % not a scalar

We solve the BVP and compare the result to the exact solution.

:open:


```{code-cell}
lambda = 10;

The following functions define the ODE.

```{code-cell}
p = @(x) zeros(size(x));            
q = @(x) -lambda^2 * ones(size(x));
r = @(x) lambda^2 * ones(size(x));

We compare the computed solution to the exact one for increasing $n$.

```{code-cell}
p = @(x) zeros(size(x));            
q = @(x) -lambda^2 * ones(size(x));

    err(k) = norm(exact(x) - u, Inf);
end
disp(table(n, err, variableNames = ["n", "inf-norm error"]))

Each factor of 10 in $n$ reduces error by a factor of 100, which is indicative of second-order convergence.

### 10.5 @section-bvp-nonlinear
(demo-nonlinear-pendulum-matlab)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-nonlinear-pendulum
:open:
Suppose a damped pendulum satisfies the nonlinear equation $\theta'' + 0.05\theta'+\sin \theta =0$. We want to start the pendulum at $\theta=2.5$ and give it the right initial velocity so that it reaches $\theta=-2$ at exactly $t=5$. This is a boundary-value problem with Dirichlet conditions $\theta(0)=2.5$ and $\theta(5)=-2$.

The first step is to define the function $\phi$ that equals $\theta''$.

```{code-cell}
phi = @(t,theta,omega) -0.05 * omega - sin(theta);
```

Next, we define the boundary conditions.

```{code-cell}
ga = @(u, du) u - 2.5;
gb = @(u, du) u + 2;
```

The last ingredient is an initial estimate of the solution. Here we choose $n=100$ and a linear function between the endpoint values. 

```{code-cell}
init = linspace(2.5, -2, 101)';
```

We find a solution with negative initial slope, i.e., the pendulum is initially pushed back toward equilibrium.

```{code-cell}
[t, theta] = bvp(phi, 0, 5, ga, gb, init);
clf,  plot(t, theta)
xlabel('t'),  ylabel('\theta(t)')
title('Pendulum over [0,5]')
```

If we extend the time interval longer for the same boundary values, then the initial slope must adjust.

```{code-cell}
[t, theta] = bvp(phi, 0, 8, ga, gb, init);
plot(t,theta)
xlabel('t'),  ylabel('\theta(t)')
title('Pendulum over [0,8]')
```

This time, the pendulum is initially pushed toward the unstable equilibrium in the upright vertical position before gravity pulls it back down.

(demo-nonlinear-mems-matlab)=
``````{dropdown} @demo-nonlinear-mems
:open:

Here is the problem definition. We use a truncated domain to avoid division by zero at $r=0$.

```{code-cell}
lambda = 0.5;
phi = @(r,w,dwdr) lambda./w.^2 - dwdr./r;
ga = @(w, dw) dw;
gb = @(w, dw) w - 1;
a = eps;  b = 1;
```

First we try a constant function as the initialization.

```{code-cell}
init = ones(301, 1);
[r, w1] = bvp(phi, a, b, ga, gb, init);

clf,  plot(r, w1)
xlabel('r'),  ylabel('w(r)')
title('Solution of the MEMS BVP')
```

It's not necessary that the initialization satisfy the boundary conditions. In fact, by choosing a different constant function as the initial guess, we arrive at another valid solution.

```{code-cell}
init = 0.5 * ones(301, 1);
[r, w2] = bvp(phi, a, b, ga, gb, init);
hold on,  plot(r, w2)

epsilon = 0.05;
phi = @(x, u, du_dx) (u.^3 - u) / epsilon;
ga = @(u, du) du;
gb = @(u, du) u - 1;
```

Finding a solution is easy at larger values of $\epsilon$.

```{code-cell}
init = linspace(-1, 1, 141)';
[x, u1] = bvp(phi, 0, 1, ga, gb, init);
clf,  plot(x, u1, displayname="\epsilon = 0.05")
xlabel('x'),  ylabel('u(x)')
title('Allen-Cahn solution') 
legend(location="northwest") 
```

However, finding a good initialization is not trivial for smaller values of $\epsilon$. Note below that the iteration stops without converging to a solution.

```{code-cell}
epsilon = 0.002;
phi = @(x, u, du_dx) (u.^3 - u) / epsilon;
[x, z] = bvp(phi, 0, 1, ga, gb, init);
```

The iteration succeeds if we use the first solution instead as the initialization here.

```{code-cell}
[x, u2] = bvp(phi, 0, 1, ga, gb, u1);
hold on,  plot(x, u2, displayname="\epsilon = 0.002")
```

In this case we can continue further.

```{code-cell}
epsilon = 0.0005;
phi = @(x, u, du_dx) (u.^3 - u) / epsilon;
[x, u3] = bvp(phi, 0, 1, ga, gb, u2);
plot(x, u3, displayname="\epsilon = 0.0005")
