It provides the engineer with the tools and guidance necessary to apply the methods successfully, and it furnishes the mathematician with a comprehensive, rigorous theory of the subject. All of the essential components of spectral algorithms currently employed for large-scale computations in fluid mechanics are described in detail. Some specific applications are linear stability, boundary layer calculations, direct simulations of transition and turbulence, and compressible Euler equations. The authors also present complete algorithms for Poisson's equation, linear hyperbolic systems, the advection diffusion equation, isotropic turbulence, and boundary layer transition. Some recent developments stressed in the book are iterative techniques (including the spectral multigrid method), spectral shock-fitting algorithms, and spectral multidomain methods. The book addresses graduate students and researchers in fluid dynamics and applied mathematics as well as engineers working on problems of practical importance.},

  abstract = {Principal component analysis is central to the study of multivariate data. Although one of the earliest multivariate techniques it continues to be the subject of much research, ranging from new model- based approaches to algorithmic ideas from neural networks. It is extremely versatile with applications in many disciplines. The first edition of this book was the first comprehensive text written solely on principal component analysis. The second edition updates and substantially expands the original version, and is once again the definitive text on the subject. It includes core material, current research and a wide range of applications. Its length is nearly double that of the first edition. Researchers in statistics, or in other fields that use principal component analysis, will find that the book gives an authoritative yet accessible account of the subject. It is also a valuable resource for graduate courses in multivariate analysis. The book requires some knowledge of matrix algebra. Ian Jolliffe is Professor of Statistics at the University of Aberdeen. He is author or co-author of over 60 research papers and three other books. His research interests are broad, but aspects of principal component analysis have fascinated him and kept him busy for over 30 years.},

  abstract = {Linear and nonlinear systems of equations are the basis for many, if not most, of the models of phenomena in science and engineering, and their efficient numerical solution is critical to progress in these areas. This is the first book to be published on nonlinear equations since the mid-1980s. Although it stresses recent developments in this area, such as Newton-Krylov methods, considerable material on linear equations has been incorporated. This book focuses on a small number of methods and treats them in depth. The author provides a complete analysis of the conjugate gradient and generalized minimum residual iterations as well as recent advances including Newton-Krylov methods, incorporation of inexactness and noise into the analysis, new proofs and implementations of Broyden\&\#39;s method, and globalization of inexact Newton methods.},

  abstract = {(1) One of the most striking features in the study of epidemics is the difficulty of finding a causal factor which appears to be adequate to account for the magnitude of the frequent epidemics of disease which visit almost every population. It was with a view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects of the various factors which govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the work of Ross and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same problem is attacked. The problem is here carried to a further stage, and it is considered from a point of view which is in one sense more general. The problem may be summarised as follows: One (or more) infected person is introduced into a community of individuals, more or less susceptible to the disease in question. The disease spreads from the affected to the unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person runs through the course of his sickness, and finally is removed from the number of those who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances of recovery or death vary from day to day during the course of his illness. The chances that the affected may convey infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent upon the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number of unaffected members of the community becomes reduced. Since the course of an epidemic is short compared with the life of an individual, the population may be considered as remaining constant, except in as far as it is modified by deaths due to the epidemic disease itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come to an end. One of the most important probems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination occurs only when no susceptible individuals are left, or whether the interplay of the various factors of infectivity, recovery and mortality, may result in termination, whilst many susceptible individuals are still present in the unaffected population. It is difficult to treat this problem in its most general aspect. In the present communication discussion will be limited to the case in which all members of the community are initially equally susceptible to the disease, and it will be further assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single infection.},

These equations describe a wide range of wave propagation and transport phenomena arising in nearly every scientific and engineering discipline. Several applications are described in a self-contained manner, along with much of the mathematical theory of hyperbolic problems. High-resolution versions of Godunov's method are developed, in which Riemann problems are solved to determine the local wave structure and limiters are applied to eliminate numerical oscillations. The methods were orginally designed to capture shock waves accurately, but are also useful tools for studying linear wave-progagation problems, particulary in heterogenous material. The methods studied are in the CLAWPACK software package. Source code for all the examples presented can be found on the web, along with animations of many of the simulations. This provides an excellent learning environment for understanding wave propagation phenomena and finite volume methods.},

A reasonable un derstanding of the mathematical structure of these equations and their solutions is first required, and Part I of these notes deals with this theory. Part II deals more directly with numerical methods, again with the emphasis on general tools that are of broad use. I have stressed the underlying ideas used in various classes of methods rather than present ing the most sophisticated methods in great detail. My aim was to provide a sufficient background that students could then approach the current research literature with the necessary tools and understanding. Without the wonders of TeX and LaTeX, these notes would never have been put together. The professional-looking results perhaps obscure the fact that these are indeed lecture notes. Some sections have been reworked several times by now, but others are still preliminary. I can only hope that the errors are. not too blatant.

Caffeine was also given to a single subject intravenously in doses of 300, 500 and 750 mg. Caffeine was rapidly absorbed and was completely available at all doses. The apparent first-order elimination rate constant decreased linearly with dose and was 0.163{$\pm$}0.081 h-1 for 50 mg and 0.098{$\pm$}0.027 h-1 for 750 mg. The total body clearance was unaffected by dose and was 0.98{$\pm$}0.38 ml/min/kg. There was a trend towards increasing apparent volume of distribution with increasing dose. A linear relationship existed between the area under the plasma concentration, time curve and dose and dose-normalised plasma concentration, time plots were superimposable. These findings suggest that caffeine obeys linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range investigated. Despite significant inter-individual differences in pharmacokinetic parameters there was good reproducibility within 5 subjects given 300 mg caffeine orally on 3 occasions. Salivary caffeine levels probably reflect the unbound plasma caffeine concentration and can be used to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug. Overall the saliva/plasma concentration ratio was 0.74{$\pm$}0.08 but within subjects some time-dependence of the ratio was found with higher ratios initially (even after intravenous administration) and lower ratios at longer time intervals after the dose. Urinary elimination of caffeine was low and independent of dose: 1.83\% of the dose was eliminated unchanged.},

This is done using the MATLAB software environment which is user-friendly and widely adopted. Within any specific class of problems, the most appropriate scientific computing algorithms are reviewed, their theoretical analyses are carried out and the expected results are verified on a MATLAB computer implementation. Every chapter is supplied with examples, exercises and applications of the discussed theory to the solution of real-life problems.This book is addressed to senior undergraduate and graduate students with particular focus on degree courses in Engineering, Mathematics, Physics and Computer Sciences. The attention which is paid to the applications and the related development of software makes it valuable also for researchers and users of scientific computing in a large variety of professional fields.},

The size and complexity of the new generation of linear and nonlinear systems arising in typical applications has grown. Solving the three-dimensional models of these problems using direct solvers is no longer effective. At the same time, parallel computing has penetrated these application areas as it became less expensive and standardized. Iterative methods are easier than direct solvers to implement on parallel computers but require approaches and solution algorithms that are different from classical methods. Iterative Methods for Sparse Linear Systems, Second Edition gives an in-depth, up-to-date view of practical algorithms for solving large-scale linear systems of equations. These equations can number in the millions and are sparse in the sense that each involves only a small number of unknowns. The methods described are iterative, i.e., they provide sequences of approximations that will converge to the solution.},

  abstract = {This is the second volume in a projected five-volume survey of numerical linear algebra and matrix algorithms. It treats the numerical solution of dense and large-scale eigenvalue problems with an emphasis on algorithms and the theoretical background required to understand them. The notes and reference sections contain pointers to other methods along with historical comments. The book is divided into two parts: dense eigenproblems and large eigenproblems. The first part gives a full treatment of the widely used QR algorithm, which is then applied to the solution of generalized eigenproblems and the computation of the singular value decomposition. The second part treats Krylov sequence methods such as the Lanczos and Arnoldi algorithms and presents a new treatment of the Jacobi-Davidson method. These volumes are not intended to be encyclopedic, but provide the reader with the theoretical and practical background to read the research literature and implement or modify new algorithms.},

  abstract = {Mathematics is playing an ever more important role in the physical and biological sciences, provoking a blurring of boundaries between scientific disciplines and a resurgence of interest in the modern as well as the classical techniques of applied mathematics. This renewal of interest, both in re search and teaching, has led to the establishment of the series Texts in Applied Mathematics (TAM). The development of new courses is a natural consequence of a high level of excitement on the research frontier as newer techniques, such as numeri cal and symbolic computer systems, dynamical systems, and chaos, mix with and reinforce the traditional methods of applied mathematics. Thus, the purpose of this textbook series is to meet the current and future needs of these advances and to encourage the teaching of new courses. TAM will publish textbooks suitable for use in advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate courses, and will complement the Applied Mathe matical Sciences (AMS) series, which will focus on advanced textbooks and research-level monographs.},

Seven-line MATLAB codes are presented that implement both methods, and experiments show that the supposed factor-of-2 advantage of Gauss quadrature is rarely realized. Theorems are given to explain this effect. First, following O'Hara and Smith in the 1960s, the phenomenon is explained as a consequence of aliasing of coefficients in Chebyshev expansions. Then another explanation is offered based on the interpretation of a quadrature formula as a rational approximation of \$\textbackslash log((z+1)/(z-1))\$ in the complex plane. Gauss quadrature corresponds to Pad\'e approximation at \$z=\textbackslash infty\$. Clenshaw\textendash Curtis quadrature corresponds to an approximation whose order of accuracy at \$z=\textbackslash infty\$ is only half as high, but which is nevertheless equally accurate near \$[-1,1]\$.},
