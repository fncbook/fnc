Furthermore, this may be the first course you have taken that does not fit neatly within a major discipline. Von Neumann’s use of “impurer” in the quote above is a telling one: numerical computation is about solving problems, and the search for solution methods that work well can take us across intellectual disciplinary boundaries.

There are less tangible benefits as well. Having a new context to wrestle with concepts like Taylor series and matrices may shed new light on why they are important enough to learn.

Instead we hope for students to experience an echo of that “obscene interest” that von Neumann so gleefully described and pursued. For while there are excellent practical reasons to learn about numerical computing, it also stands as a subject of intellectual and even emotional relevance. We have seen students excited and motivated by applications of their newly found abilities to problems in mechanics, biology, networks, finance, and more—problems that are of unmistakable importance in the jungle beyond university textbooks, yet largely impenetrable using only the techniques learned within our well-tended gardens.","position":{"start":{"line":23,"column":1},"end":{"line":23,"column":1}},"key":"brjSSLqiE7"}],"key":"Btw8nHphON"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":25,"column":1},"end":{"line":25,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In writing this book, we have not attempted to be encyclopedic.
