[**Demo %s**](#demo-pivoting-usage)

The third output of `plufact` is the permutation vector we need to apply to $\mathbf{A}$.

```{code-cell}
A = randi(20, 4, 4);
[L, U, p] = plufact(A);
A(p, :) - L * U    % should be â‰ˆ 0
```

Given a vector $\mathbf{b}$, we solve $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ by first permuting the entries of $\mathbf{b}$ and then proceeding as before.

```{code-cell}
b = rand(4, 1);
z = forwardsub(L, b(p));
x = backsub(U, z)
```

A residual check is successful:

```{code-cell}
b - A*x
```
