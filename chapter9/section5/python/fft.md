[**Demo %s**](#demo-trig-fft)

This function has frequency content at $2\pi$, $-2\pi$, and $\pi$. 

```{code-cell}
f = lambda x: 3 * cos(2 * pi * x) - exp(1j * pi * x)
```

To use `fft`, we set up nodes in the interval $[0,2)$. 

```{code-cell}
n = 4
N = 2 * n + 1
t = 2 * arange(0, N) / N    # nodes in [0,2)
y = f(t)
```

We perform Fourier analysis using `fft` and then examine the resulting coefficients.

```{code-cell}
from scipy.fftpack import fft, ifft, fftshift
c = fft(y) / N
freq = hstack([arange(n+1), arange(-n,0)])
results = PrettyTable()
results.add_column("freq", freq) 
results.add_column("coefficient", c)
results
```

Note that $1.5 e^{2i\pi x}+1.5 e^{-2i\pi x} = 3 \cos(2\pi x)$, so this result is sensible.

Fourier's greatest contribution to mathematics was to point out that *every* periodic function is just a combination of frequenciesâ€”infinitely many of them in general, but truncated for computational use. Here we look at the magnitudes of the coefficients for $f(x) = \exp( \sin(\pi x) )$.

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-input]
f = lambda x: exp(sin(pi * x))    # content at all frequencies
n = 9;  N = 2*n + 1;
t = 2 * arange(0, N) / N    # nodes in [0,2)
c = fft(f(t)) / N

semilogy(range(-n, n+1), abs(fftshift(c)), "o")
xlabel("$k$"),  ylabel("$|c_k|$")
title("Fourier coefficients");
```

The Fourier coefficients of smooth functions decay exponentially in magnitude as a function of the frequency. This decay rate is determines the convergence of the interpolation error.
