Those concerned primarily with prototyping and perfecting algorithms, particularly those involving lots of linear algebra, optimization, and differential equations, were happy to adopt MATLAB as a primary computing environment.

There were drawbacks, however, when it came to performance, scalability, and language features beyond the manipulation of vectors and matrices.
