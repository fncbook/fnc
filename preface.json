Those concerned primarily with prototyping and perfecting algorithms, particularly those involving lots of linear algebra, optimization, and differential equations, were happy to adopt MATLAB as a primary computing environment. It offered concise syntax for such problems, freedom from variable types and declarations, compiling, and linking programs, convenient tools for analyzing results, and cross-platform uniformity. There were drawbacks, however, when it came to performance, scalability, and language features beyond the manipulation of vectors and matrices. While MATLAB has steadily made serious progress on closing the performance gap and introducing new language features, there remain computing tasks for which it is not ideally suited.","position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1},"end":{"line":3,"column":1}},"key":"KroAhR2GkZ"}],"key":"tsgN0zF2Pg"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The landscape changed when the SciPy, NumPy, and Matplotlib packages for scientific computing in Python became stable and polished.
