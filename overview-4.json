Accordingly, our next task is to represent functions numerically. This task is more difficult and complicated than the one we faced in representing real numbers. With numbers, it’s intuitively clear how one real value can stand for a small interval around it. But designating representatives for sets of functions is less straightforward—in fact, it’s one of the core topics in computing.
