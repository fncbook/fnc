    "The equation $u'=\\sin[(u+t)^2]$ also has a solution that can be found numerically with ease, even though no formula exists for its solution. The `DifferentialEquations` package offers solvers for a variety of problems. Because many practical problems come with parameters that are fixed within an instance but varied from one instance to another, the syntax for IVPs includes a input argument `p` that stays fixed throughout the solution. Here we don't use that argument, but it must be in our definition for the solver to work."
